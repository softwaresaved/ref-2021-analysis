1.3 Structure and management
1.3.1 Departments
Physics at UCL is structured into three departments (see Figure 1, yellow text) within the Faculty of
Mathematical And Physical Sciences (MAPS), which is in turn part of the BEAMS School (Built
Environment, Engineering And Mathematical and Physical Sciences). This maintains broad
research excellence across the discipline while seizing opportunities in particular technology areas.
      Physics & Astronomy (P&A) is the main undergraduate teaching department and the
       largest unit (68.9 FTE academic staff excluding LCN joint appointments – see below, 87
       FTE research staff, 272 postgraduate research students). Research covers the full breadth
       of the subject and is structured into five main groups: Astronomy and Astrophysics (Astro),
       Biological Physics (BP), High-Energy Physics (HEP), Condensed Matter and Materials
       Physics (CMMP) and Atomic, Molecular, Optical and Positron Physics (AMOPP). The

                                                                                             Page 2
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
       department is based on UCL’s central Bloomsbury campus, and also occupies space at the
       Royal Institution and the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus. It runs UCL’s flourishing
       undergraduate physics programme (annual intake rose from 149 to 250 over the period).
      Space & Climate Physics (SCP) is located at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory
       (MSSL), near Dorking in Surrey (25.4 FTE academic staff, 33 FTE research staff, 51
       research students) and also has offices in Bloomsbury. The MSSL site includes a 19th-
       century country house, and purpose-built laboratories and cleanrooms that would be
       difficult to accommodate in Bloomsbury. It is focused on the opportunities in astrophysics
       and solar system science afforded by space missions. A team of 85 specialist engineers
       constructs spacecraft-borne instruments, working closely with scientific research groups
       defining the missions and exploiting the data. The department actively transfers expertise
       in project management and systems engineering to the private sector via CPD courses and
       MSc apprenticeships.
      The London Centre for Nanotechnology (LCN) is an interdisciplinary research
       department, centred in a purpose-built building adjacent to P&A, having joint academic staff
       with P&A (CMMP and BP groups), Electronic & Electrical Engineering, Computer Science,
       Chemistry, Biological Sciences, Biochemical Engineering, Medicine, and Earth Sciences.
       LCN returns 17.2 FTE staff in this UoA, mostly joint with P&A but including one with
       Computer Science; there are 18 FTE associated research staff, while physics-related
       students are included in the numbers for P&A above. The LCN also forms a cross-London
       collaboration with Imperial and (in a new strategic initiative during the period) King’s
       College London – staff submitted by home institutions. Its mission is to pursue
       opportunities offered by the tools of modern nanoscience across a range of science and
       technology areas, focusing on information technology, healthcare and the environment, and
       to make those tools available to the widest possible community.
Each department has a management group, with representation across its portfolio, that advises its
head on strategic and operational issues. The heads meet regularly to agree the overall research
vision for physics, and have monthly one-to-one meetings with the Dean of MAPS. Five-year
strategic plans for each department are approved annually by the Dean and feed into the Faculty’s
own objectives. An interdisciplinary LCN stakeholder group brings together the Deans/Heads
partner faculties/departments; the LCN Directors from UCL, Imperial and King’s also meet regularly
to coordinate cross-institutional strategy. The Heads of Department and the Dean are all active
researchers, and UCL has always been clear that they are expected to act as scholars first and
managers second.
1.3.2 Cross-cutting Centres and Institutes
UCL dynamically forms centres and institutes to address both major research questions and critical
societal needs. Alongside their established participation in the LCN, UCL physicists play a
prominent role in several such groupings.
      The UCL Quantum Science and Technology Institute (UCLQ) brings together
       researchers in the rapidly developing area of quantum technologies across UCL. Led from
       the LCN, it includes groups from P&A, Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Computer
       Science and Chemistry (33 academic staff, 15 in UoA9).
      The Centre for Planetary Sciences (CPS) brings together the planetary science groups in
       P&A, SCP and Earth Sciences along with Birkbeck College (45 academic staff, 18 in
       UoA9).
      The new UCL Centre for Space Exochemistry Data (CSED) in the Harwell Space Cluster
       brings together researchers from the Astro and AMOPP groups, Computer Science and
       RAL Space, promoting collaborations between astrophysical science, AI, industry, public
       sector organisations and SMEs.
      The Cosmoparticle Initiative (CPI) links the Astro, HEP and AMOPP research groups in
       P&A with SCP, with a core of 13 academic staff. Its focus is on the overlap between
       cosmology and astro-particle physics, with a focus in areas such as dark matter, early-
       universe physics and neutrino physics.
      The Thomas Young Centre (TYC) links researchers from UCL, Imperial, King’s and QMUL
       interested in the theory and simulation of materials across length- and time-scales. UCL’s
                                                                                             Page 3
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
       participation is led from the P&A CMMP group (7 staff), and covers the LCN, Chemistry and
       Earth Sciences as well as engineering and biomedical departments. The centre hosts an
       active visitor programme and organises regular ‘soirées’ presenting contrasting views of
       current research.
      The Institute for the Physics of Living Systems (IPLS) brings together researchers from
       P&A, the LCN, the Division of Biosciences, the Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology (all at
       UCL) and the Francis Crick Institute (25 academic staff, 5 from UoA9). Supported by major
       investment from the Provost’s Strategic Development Fund, it tackles fundamental
       questions in the physics of biological matter including cell and tissue mechanics.
1.4 Overview of our research
Physics research at UCL covers a full spectrum from the largest to the smallest length-scales.
1.4.1 Astrophysics and Space Science (44.1 FTE staff)
Research in astrophysics and space science at UCL covers an exceptionally broad range including
cosmology, extra-galactic, galactic and stellar astrophysics, exoplanets, solar physics, space
plasma physics, and planetary science. Its key strength is in integrating theoretical and
computational developments in each area with observational expertise and leadership,
including on many large international collaborations. This position is based on an exceptional
community, including an unusually large cohort of specialist engineers; the synergies between
different areas, and the numerous leadership positions we occupy, provide outstanding
opportunities for UCL researchers.
We build on this broad programme by developing and exploiting instrumentation for both ground-
based facilities and space missions, by making new connections between cosmology and particle
physics, and through leveraging leadership roles. Following our earlier success proposing and
scientifically leading the ESA Cryosat mission, the three most recent space science missions
approved by the European Space Agency (ESA) were all proposed by (and are now under the
science leadership of) UCL staff, an unprecedented concentration of space research leadership in
a single university. Figure 2 highlights our involvement in space missions during the REF period,
and our leadership in upcoming major missions; leads form consortia, coordinate proposals against
fierce competition, work with agencies to deliver the missions, and lead the science after launch.
We have strategically developed science programmes alongside our leadership in instrumentation
and management.

approved by the worldwide space agencies since 2000. Grey bars denote build phase and thick
coloured bars the (currently funded) mission duration. Data analysis and exploitation generally
continues long after operations end.

Our research achievements demonstrate vitality across the sub-fields.
      Cosmology and large-scale structure: we were founding members of the ground-based
       Dark Energy Survey (DES, 2013-19, data analysis continuing) and Dark Energy
       Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI, 2019-), combining critical instrumentation contributions
       with scientific leadership. The first year DES data demonstrated the power of the “multi-
       probe” approach followed by all subsequent dark-energy projects. We have successfully
       exploited data taken by Planck (ESA mission 2009-2019) to test models of cosmic
       structure, and shared in two Breakthrough Prizes in Fundamental Physics (in 2015 to the
       Supernova Cosmology Project, in 2018 to the WMAP Consortium). We lead one of the two
       instruments on Euclid (ESA M2 mission, 2022 launch) aimed at understanding dark energy
       and dark matter, and have a senior leadership role in its scientific consortium.
      Extragalactic and galactic astrophysics, and stellar evolution: We participated in the
       reconstruction of a supermassive black-hole image by the Event Horizon Telescope team,
       contributing modelling of general relativistic radiation transfer (sharing a further 2020
       Breakthrough Prize). Using a UCL-built and led telescope on NASA’s Swift satellite, we
       discovered unexpectedly intense ultraviolet emission from the first merger of binary neutron
       stars to be observed via gravitational waves. We are major contributors to the Gaia mission
       (launched 2013), which measures position and radial velocity of about 1.7 billion stars in
       our galaxy and the local group; UCL calibrated the detector chains and made a major
       contribution to the Radial Velocity Spectrometer alongside involvement in the analysis. We
       made a range of discoveries (e.g. dust in the reionization era, structures of tori around
       active galactic nuclei) using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). We have PI
       leadership and management roles in the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. We compared
       the effects of star formation and super-massive black holes on galactic evolution by
       exploiting data from the Herschel mission (where UCL had a strong role in the SPIRE
       instrument) throughout the review period. We also lead the e-MERLIN radio astronomy
       legacy project COBRaS, surveying massive star and binary populations in the Galaxy.
      Exoplanets: we reported the first discovery of water in the atmosphere of a small planet in
       the habitable zone. We have science PI leadership in the Ariel mission (ESA M4
                                                                                                 Page 5
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
       mission, 2029 launch) which will characterize the chemical composition and thermal
       structure of transiting exoplanet atmospheres). We lead front-end electronics development
       and sensor characterisation for PLATO (ESA M3 mission, 2026 launch) which will search
       for Earth-like rocky exoplanets in the habitable zone) and lead two work-packages in the
       science consortium.
      Solar system physics: we have science PI leadership in the Comet Interceptor mission
       (ESA/Japan F1 mission, 2029 launch with Ariel) and expect to be PI for its EnVisS
       instrument (final selection in progress). We also have the European science co-PI
       leadership in the SMILE mission (ESA/China, 2024 launch), which will measure the
       Earth’s magnetosphere’s global response to solar wind and geomagnetic variations. We
       lead the Solar Wind Analyser instrument suite for Solar Orbiter (the ESA/NASA M1 mission,
       launched 2020) and uniquely have a major hardware role in a second instrument, the
       Extreme Ultraviolet Imager. We are PI for the PanCam panoramic camera for the
       Exomars Rosalind Franklin Rover (to launch 2022). We also lead the Extreme
       Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer for Hinode, which has yielded a wealth of information
       about solar physics and solar flares, and the Electron Spectrometer sensor of the Cassini
       Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS‐ ELS) in the Cassini-Huygens mission which unexpectedly
       discovered complex negative ions in the atmosphere of Titan. UCL is PI for the PEACE
       electron analysers on the Cluster II multi-spacecraft mission (ESA/NASA, launched 2000),
       which produced data contradicting the standard substorm current wedge model during the
       review period.
      Theoretical and computational astrophysics and cosmology: we brought together
       simulation and analytic studies to analyse cosmological and galactic surveys, yielding high-
       profile results including the most powerful test of cosmic isotropy to date. Our numerical
       codes led to award-winning insights into phase transitions in the early Universe. Our work
       on chemistry in the interstellar medium and in exoplanetary atmospheres links with the
       ExoMol molecular line-lists project, which has been reviewed as Europe’s largest
       contribution to Exoplanet Science and connects the Astrophysics and AMOPP groups.
During the assessment period
      We invested in new space at Harwell to support CSED and the Ariel project team in close
       proximity to RAL Space, where the Ariel instrument will be tested and assembled;
      We refurbished space in Bloomsbury for a relocation of the Astrophysics Group and the
       establishment of the Cosmoparticle Initiative (see Section 1.3.2);
      We made four new appointments to expand research in exoplanets and to support Ariel
       and PLATO (Waldmann – ERC Starting Grant, Van Eylen, Kama and Pinilla – to start in
       2021);
      We appointed Ellis (ERC Advanced Grant) and Feeney (RS-URF with proleptic
       Lectureship) to strengthen observational and computational cosmology, Schoenrich
       and Sanders (RS-URF with proleptic Lectureships) in galactic astrophysics, Long,
       Verscharen (both proleptic STFC-ERFs) and Reid in space plasma and solar physics.
In the coming period we plan major developments in
      Gravitational waves and time-domain astronomy, including multi-messenger
       observation of compact object mergers. UCL recently jointed LISA; we are currently
       making an appointment in this area, and actively supporting applicants for fellowships;
      The dark universe, including exploitation of the data from the DESI survey (observations
       from 2020), the Euclid mission, and the LSST survey;
      Laboratory cosmology, exploiting connections to quantum technologies for the detection
       of gravitational waves and dark matter, and quantum simulations of the physics of the early
       universe and black holes within condensed-matter systems or cold atomic gases,
       supported by the Cosmoparticle Initiative (see Section 1.3.2);
      Extra-solar planets, with frontier areas including the determination of atmospheric
       compositions and the search for life, and preparation for launches of PLATO and Ariel.
       Alongside the CSED, we are also pioneering a new commercial approach to create


                                                                                           Page 6
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
       opportunities for cutting-edge science satellites through a UCL start-up, Blue Skies Space
       Ltd.
      Helio-physics: our instruments on Solar Orbiter recently joined those currently operating
       on Cluster and Hinode, contributing to the ‘Grand Heliospheric Observatory’ which will lead
       to very significant advances in solar, stellar, and space plasma physics over the next
       decade. We are seeking UKSA support to participate in SOLAR-C EUVST;
      Space weather, where we run training courses for Met Office forecasters, collaborate
       closely to improve accuracy, and are preparing the solar wind plasma instrument for the
       ESA Lagrange mission;
      The search for evidence of historical life on Mars, using the ESA ExoMars Rover;
      Studies of planetary magnetospheres, exploiting particle, field and imaging data from the
       ESA JUICE mission and planning Ganymede aurora observations from 2032;
      Support for all areas will be developed by enhancing theoretical and numerical activities.
       Cross-cutting areas including chemical complexity, astro-statistics and astro-
       informatics. Our CDT in Data Intensive Science (see below) will grow activities at the
       interface between astrophysics, space physics and data science, with further investment
       from the Provost’s Strategic Development Fund.
1.4.2 Physics of Matter (45.8 FTE staff)
We see the substantial UCL activity across this area as a cohesive whole, spanning P&A’s Atomic,
Molecular, Optical and Positron Physics (AMOPP), Biological Physics, and Condensed Matter and
Materials Physics (CMMP) groups as well as the LCN, because of the many interconnections. The
period has seen a transformation of this area, with new unifying topics such as topological order,
active matter, out-of-equilibrium dynamics, physics of information, and quantum technologies
generating collaborations and connections to astronomy and elementary particle physics, as well
as to engineering and life sciences. Our strategy is to exploit the exceptional research at UCL in
life and medical sciences, our strength across quantum technologies (including links to engineering
and computer science through UCLQ), synergies between experiment, theory, and modelling, and
access to national and international facilities alongside local fabrication and measurement
laboratories.
      Topological matter and order: we have seen important results in experimental realisation
       of fractionalised excitations, especially monopoles in spin ices and searches for so-called
       ‘Kitaev matter’ (Majorana fermion quasiparticles). We demonstrated the first topological
       spin insulator. The period also saw experimental verification of our ‘order-by-disorder’
       picture of quantum phase transitions.
      Far-from-equilibrium dynamics: we have exploited the unprecedented time resolution of
       free-electron lasers to study dynamics of nanomaterials, developed new approaches to
       thermalisation, many-body localisation and time crystals, and continue to lead in the theory
       of out-of-equilibrium light-matter condensates in polariton systems. We also led the
       semiclassical study of new regimes in quantum interference and multiple ionization under
       intense laser fields.
      Nanomaterials and interfaces: we have developed new material types by the solution
       processing of fullerenes, graphene and other two-dimensional materials, and produced the
       first phosphorene nanoribbons. We gained key insights into the process of
       biomineralization, determining conditions for formation of defects in inorganic crystals
       templated on organic scaffolds. We demonstrated the phenomenon of negative
       capacitance in ferroelectric multilayers, and identified the sites for nucleation of ices on dust
       particles (with major implications for atmospheric science).
      Physics of living systems: our programme probing biological matter from molecular to
       cellular length scales yielded insights into functional and pathological self-assembly, e.g.
       the formation of nanopores by immune proteins and the formation and self-replication of
       amyloids and other protein fibrils. We established fundamental models of cell division and
       force transmission in the cytoskeleton, and made key contributions to quantum biology,
       highlighting the importance of non-classical vibrations in photosynthetic energy transfer
       under ambient conditions.

                                                                                                Page 7
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
      Physics of information: we developed information-theoretic approaches to both the
       Second and Third Laws of thermodynamics. We demonstrated the computational power of
       non-local correlations and showed it can be quantified by contextuality, also that gauge
       colour codes can perform fault-tolerant error correction in quantum computers.
      Cold atoms, molecules and hybrid systems: we developed chip-based architectures
       manipulating cold Rydberg atoms and molecules, and demonstrated matter-wave
       interferometry with them — at ~500 nm, the largest objects for which interference has been
       observed. We realised a quantum interface between Rydberg atoms and superconducting
       circuits and demonstrated guiding and velocity selection of positronium in Rydberg states.
       We demonstrated instabilities in systems of cold atoms coupled to optical cavities and
       controlled resonant energy transfer in cold collisions using electric fields, and continued to
       lead the calculation of high-accuracy molecular line-lists (notably through the ExoMol
       project, key to the exoplanet field). We demonstrated cavity cooling control of levitated
       nanoparticles, realised new cooling schemes for mechanical oscillators using whispering-
       gallery modes, and developed sensors for acceleration and magnetic induction imaging
       based on nanoparticles and atomic gases.
      Low-energy fundamental physics: we proposed new experimental demonstrations of the
       quantum nature of gravity in the laboratory using entanglement, and proposed new gravity
       sensors using levitated nanoparticles. We identified significant disagreement with existing
       theory in the fine structure of positronium and are exploiting our matter-wave interferometry
       of Rydberg states to test the weak equivalence principle for antimatter.
During the assessment period
      With support (>£400k) from the Provost’s Strategic Development Fund we met a target in
       the last REF through a major development in biological physics, appointing Saric (ERC
       Starting Grant and RS-URF) and Bannerjee (RS-URF) in theory, and transferring Llorente-
       Garcia (UCL-Crick fellow) to an academic position in experiment. We seized the
       opportunity presented by the Francis Crick Institute (FCI), appointing Molodtsov and
       Hadjivasiliou (after the period) as joint group leaders at the physics-biomedicine interface
       (transferring fully to UCL in 2025 and 2027); we also appointed (after the period) Michaels
       to a further theory position.
      We strengthened connections with central facilities science by the appointments of
       Kruger (joint with ISIS) and Johnson in X-ray and neutron scattering of multiferroics and
       quantum materials.
      The appointments of Pal (ERC Starting Grant) in many-body localisation and thermalisation
       and Rosta in novel atomistic simulations further broadened our strengths in condensed
       matter theory, chemical and biological physics, also catalysing a major (£6M) EPSRC
       programme grant held in the LCN by Pepper (returned in UoA12).
      We transferred Yurchenko to an academic position, strengthening the ExoMol project team
       and connections to exoplanet science.
      Fulfilling targets in the last REF we grew connections through new joint appointments, to
       fundamental computer science through the LCN and Computer Science (Masanes,
       returned in UoA9), and to device physics through LCN and Electronic & Electrical
       Engineering (Lombardo, returned in UoA12).
      We consolidated our leading position in quantum technologies across UCLQ with the award
       and renewal of the successful EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Quantum
       Technologies (£5.0M, £6.2M), a Skills Hub in Quantum Systems Engineering (£3.6M),
       a major expansion of our equipment base supported by the largest capital grant (£8M)
       from the National Quantum Technologies Programme, participation in the Quantum
       Computing and Simulation Hub (£2.5M, with UCL equipment/estates investment of
       £323k) and a Prosperity Partnership in quantum software with Google (£2M).
In the coming period we see particular opportunities through:
      Extending our work on topological materials to thin films and exploiting connections with
       spintronics;


                                                                                              Page 8
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
      Exploiting new X-ray sources and free-electron lasers to study the early dynamics of
       emerging complex orders;
      Studying increasingly complex biological systems and mechanisms;
      Bringing quantum technologies including quantum information processors and quantum
       sensors to wider use;
      Opening a new era of precision measurements, including low-energy tests of
       fundamental physics, through a frequency comb laser;
      A new LCN programme exploiting novel liquid ion sources for nanofabrication (Perez
       Martinez, UKRI Fellow);
      Combining our unique expertise in trapping cold hydrogen isotopes with neutrino physics
       through a new measurement of the absolute neutrino mass using atomic tritium.
1.4.3 Elementary Particle Physics (21.6 FTE staff)
We have a broad leadership in both accelerator-based and non-accelerator particle physics, with
numerous spokesperson or analysis coordination roles, and strong integration between theory and
experiment. Our strategy is to continue exploitation of the rich data from the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) while leading searches for new physics in non-accelerator-based experiments.
      Energy frontier physics: UCL led the first measurement of the most common Higgs decay
       (𝐻 → 𝑏𝑏̅) as well as the search for resonant and non-resonant Higgs Pair production (𝐻𝐻 →
       𝑏𝑏̅𝑏𝑏̅), measured the four-lepton line-shape, and contributed to other important searches
       and measurements. We led initiatives to reinterpret measurements for the widest sensitivity
       to physics beyond the Standard Model. We provided the UK ATLAS PI and the overall
       ZEUS spokesperson during the period. We are recognised as leading analysts of the
       parton distribution functions underpinning hadron collider physics; through key CERN
       committee PDF4LHC, we guide information exchange between theory and experiments,
       maximising the information from precision measurements. We jointly led theoretical
       advances (involving the MINLO perturbation technique) underpinning new precision
       simulations, e.g. for the observation of 𝐻 → 𝑏𝑏̅, and provide the most accurate simulation of
       the main LHC Higgs production channel, vital to determinations of Higgs properties. We
       make leading contributions to the phenomenology of neutrino masses at colliders.
      Lepton physics: We play a major role in determining neutrino mass parameters and
       hence in understanding the origins of matter-antimatter asymmetry, with leading
       contributions to both theory and experiment. Our long-standing leadership in neutrino
       oscillations involved data analysis for MINOS+ and NOvA experiments, and development
       and construction of the next-generation DUNE and CHIPS projects. We provided
       spokespersons for MINOS+ and CHIPS (which we initiated), and conveners for the
       oscillation, cross-section, beam simulation and calibration working groups in NOvA. We
       have a strong presence in leadership and analysis at SuperNEMO (providing the
       spokesperson, constructing and installing tracker modules in a joint HEP-SCP project),
       securing UK presence in searches for neutrinoless double beta-decays evidencing
       Majorana neutrinos, and pioneered UK involvement in the next-generation LEGEND
       experiment (providing the chair of its Institutional Board). We have recognised leadership
       in the theory of neutrino masses and lepton number violation, and the phenomenology of
       double beta-decay searches. We have a presence, unique in the UK, in the balloon-borne
       ANITA experiment searching for new cosmic-ray and neutrino physics. We also initiated
       UK involvement in the muon (𝒈 − 𝟐) experiment, providing the overall spokesperson
       during the period, as well as in the lepton flavour-violating 𝜇2𝑒 and 𝜇3𝑒 decay searches,
       leading contributions to data acquisition systems and physics studies.
      Dark matter searches: We have a leadership role in the current direct dark matter
       searches using liquid xenon detectors (LZ experiment in South Dakota). We led the UK
       effort in the LUX experiment (providing the UK PI), setting world-leading constraints on
       WIMP dark matter during the period. We are leading proposals for the next (third)
       generation of experiments having ground-breaking sensitivity, definitively testing the WIMP
       hypothesis and extending direct searches to previously inaccessible yet equally well-
       motivated models of thermal relic dark matter. Our measurements of missing energy at
       ATLAS continued to extend limits on WIMP production. This work has close contacts with
                                                                                             Page 9

       astrophysical studies of dark matter and dark energy through the CPI – see Section 1.3.2.
       The UCL group has established the Boulby underground laboratory as a world-
       leading facility for low-background studies, underpinning leadership in international dark-
       matter projects and also environmental, geophysical and biological studies.
      New instrumentation and accelerators: in addition to developing the CHIPS experiment
       for neutrino detection and the Boulby laboratory (see above), UCL was a founding
       member of, and provides the deputy spokesperson for, the AWAKE collaboration, which
       has produced transformative results in plasma wakefield acceleration during the review
       period, and is also developing detectors for quality assurance of proton therapy beams,
       such as the new proton therapy accelerator currently being installed at UCL Hospitals.
During the period we appointed Chislett to strengthen our leadership in muon physics, transferred
Scanlon (RS-URF) to a proleptic Lectureship to reinforce our leadership in Higgs physics at ATLAS
(he also plays a major role in our CDT for Data Intensive Science), and welcomed Dobson (dark
matter) and Agostini (neutrino physics) as new Ernest Rutherford Fellows, putting UCL in a leading
position in the LEGEND experiment. After the period we also welcomed Malik (RS-URF),
strengthening links between phenomenology, experiments, and quantum technologies. In the
coming period, we foresee major developments through
      Preparing the ATLAS trigger upgrade for the high-luminosity LHC, full exploitation of LHC
       Run 3 ATLAS data, and leadership in strategic development for future colliders;
      Novel phenomenology, including novel high-precision parton shower simulations,
       increased precision and an understanding of theory uncertainties in parton distributions;
      In the neutrino sector, participation in the international DUNE experiment (where UCL
       contributed the highly successful purity monitor), leading contributions to the LEGEND
       double-beta experiment, as well as further development of CHIPS, measurements from the
       NOvA experiment, applications of quantum technologies to determine absolute neutrino
       masses, and experimental data-driven methods to improve theory predictions of double
       beta-decay;
      Leading searches for dark matter and related areas, including exploitation of the Boulby
       facility, and extending searches to ultra-light candidates using quantum technologies;
      Measurement of (𝒈 − 𝟐) for muons, and testing lepton flavour violations in 𝜇2𝑒 and 𝜇3𝑒
       experiments;
      Development of plasma wakefield acceleration as a usable technology for high-energy
       physics;
      Collaboration with UCL Medical Physics and Bioengineering and the NHS UCL Hospitals
       Trust to develop and exploit proton therapy technologies.
1.5 Impact strategy
We aim to bring about impact from our research in the broadest sense.
      Commercial impact: UCL Business (UCLB) is a wholly owned subsidiary of UCL
       responsible for negotiating technology transfer arrangements, both licensing and spin-outs.
       It works closely with UCL Innovation and Enterprise, which holds institutional-level
       partnerships and includes a dedicated Engineering, Technology and Built Environment
       team. Through them, researchers in our departments have been awarded > £925k of
       EPSRC/STFC impact acceleration and HEIF funding during the review period. These
       central teams are supplemented by specialist faculty advisers responsible to Vice-Deans
       for Enterprise; in addition to the MAPS team, the LCN (as a cross-faculty entity) also
       accesses the team in the Faculty of Engineering Science.
      Consultancy: UCL Consultants (UCLC) arranges UCL-related consultancy arrangements,
       providing legal support, billing, and allowing staff to use the UCL name. 23 staff from the
       UoA performed consultancy during the REF period, with total value of £10.3M, for
       organizations ranging from the European Space Agency to major energy, aerospace and
       pharmaceutical companies.
      Outward-facing training and professional development: we run bespoke professional
       courses in project management and systems engineering for external clients (e.g. Teledyne
       e2V) based on expertise developed for the exceptional demands of space missions. We
                                                                                          Page 10
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
       also run courses for corporate clients (e.g. Santander PLC) on quantum technologies. SCP
       has initiated a successful MSc apprenticeship scheme.
      The media and the general public: UCL Culture has a dedicated public engagement unit
       promoting activities including ‘Bright Club’ stand-up evenings and UCL’s participation in
       national initiatives such as the ‘pint of science’ scheme and the Cheltenham Science
       Festival. P&A hosts a dedicated physics outreach coordinator (co-funded since 2017 by
       the Ogden Trust). We make full use of our central London locations with public tours and
       school visits at the UCL Observatory, and an annual ‘Your Universe’ science festival in
       Bloomsbury; we also run regular open days and outreach activities at MSSL. Our staff
       have exceptional media and science communication profiles – they include a regular
       presenter of The Sky At Night and authors of prizewinning popular science books for both
       adults and children.
      Advocacy and advice to policymakers: the UCL Vice-Provost’s Office for Research has
       a dedicated team helping UCL researchers communicate policy advice, including written
       and oral evidence to the Science & Technology Select Committee enquiry on Quantum
       Technologies in 2018.
      Finally, we encourage our students to engage with the highly entrepreneurial London
       business scene, through cross-entrepreneurship events run by UCL Innovation and
       Enterprise but also through physics-focused activities such as involvement with our doctoral
       training programmes and industry-sponsored hackathons.
1.6 Open access
UCL is fully committed to open access to scientific information. Full texts of all publications are
made available through UCL Discovery – indicative of the success of this approach, 98.68% of all
publications from our departments accepted after 1 April 2016 (not just those submitted in REF2)
either have full-text uploaded or have a REF open-access exception.
We have consistently taken initiatives to ensure raw data from experiments are placed online for
analysis by all, advocating strongly for this within large collaborations.
      In particle physics, the Rivet (Robust Independent Validation for Experiment and Theory)
       software platform originated at UCL, and a UCL researcher developed the recently adopted
       ATLAS (and CERN-wide) policy on data preservation. UCL contributes a representative to
       the HEPDATA steering committee, advising on data archiving for non-LHC experiments,
       and the MINOS/MINOS+ collaboration (led by a UCL spokesperson) published its entire
       sterile-neutrino analysis dataset online.
      In astrophysics, we led the current policy within DES (and DESI) that all raw data are
       made public the year after being taken. We provided Cassini-Huygens CAPS-ELS to the
       ESA planetary science archive, and are preparing with ESA to release ExoMars PanCam
       pictures immediately after reception. We provide all Cluster and Double Star PEACE
       calibrated science data to the ESA Cluster Science Archive. Data from our Solar Orbiter
       SWA instrument will be publically available 90 days after reception.

UCL has established UCL Discovery as a publicly searchable database of UCL-created data.
Butterworth is a member of the steering group for the UCL Office for Open Science.
Many physics software projects are available open-source, including the CONQUEST linear-
scaling electronic structure package (led by Bowler) and the POWHEG toolbox for corrections to
leading-order amplitudes in collider processes (modules by Hamilton). We lead development of
the widely-used PYNBODY simulation analysis suite which has been acknowledged in >220
publications across astrophysics. We recently published the tangos platform for sharing simulation
data (The Agile Numerical Galaxy Organization System). All codes created through CSED are
open source, available on GitHub (https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/) and widely used (over 4,000
installations of TauREx3 PyPi toolkit, 44,000 downloads of PyLightcurve and Iraclis).
1.7 Research integrity
UCL fully supports the UK Concordat to support Research Integrity and has adopted a 4-level
training framework; Level 2 (Understanding Research Integrity) is required before research
                                                                                           Page 11
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
students transfer to PhD status. Training is tailored to physical sciences and starts at induction;
students and supervisors sign an ‘integrity agreement’ pledging high standards and demonstrating
understanding of misconduct. Students attend UCL’s central training course, with participation
monitored through our electronic log, and are encouraged to use a ‘dilemma game’ integrity tool.
UCL has been a leader in the development of research integrity policy, and from 2014 hosted the
UK's National Hub for Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), combining researchers,
policymakers, industry and the public. All staff and students are made aware of the routes to raise
concerns about research practices (first the Head of Department, then the Research Integrity unit
within the Office for the Vice-Provost, Research).


 2. People
People are our most important resource: the largest single contribution to our research
environment is the dynamism of our research community, across all career stages.
2.1 Equalities
In developing this community, we aim to be driven by scientific excellence. We aspire to give
opportunities, to both staff and students, on the basis of merit, irrespective of gender, race,
orientation or other protected characteristics. We aim to provide a supportive and positive
environment to our researchers, recognising that science is a demanding and sometimes
discouraging field in which to work.
2.1.1 Approach to equalities in the REF submission
All HESA category 3 (academic research and teaching) staff, and all HESA 2 (research) staff
meeting the independence criterion, were submitted. Female HESA 2 staff were less likely to be
submitted than male HESA 2 staff, because fewer currently hold independent fellowships. We
proactively encourage female research staff to apply for fellowships and 27% of those holding
fellowships during the period were female; of these, 75% now hold academic or proleptic
appointments and are therefore classified as HESA 3. The data did not allow us to draw
conclusions about selection of BME or disabled HESA 2 staff.
Outputs were initially selected, from lists submitted by individuals, by a group of senior staff
including HoDs and the P&A departmental board. All staff involved in the selection of outputs
received training in equal opportunities. The provisional list was approved by a specially convened
panel with an external chair, chosen to have an approximately equal gender balance, who were
provided with data on the overall gender and ethnicity balance of the staff, and the corresponding
outputs. Results by gender, ethnicity and age are shown in Table 1.
Table 1: summary of staff population and output profile against three characteristics.

                                                Proportions

Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
2.1.2 Equality charters and the working environment
We participate enthusiastically in the UK equality charters for higher education. These schemes
are designed for departmental units so our departments participate separately, and have inevitably
reached different stages. P&A and SCP lie within the IoP’s Project Juno: P&A has ‘Juno
champion’ status (renewed in 2019) and an associated Athena SWAN Silver Award, while SCP
received ‘Juno practitioner’ status in 2020. As an interdisciplinary centre with significant focus
outside physics, the LCN applies directly to Athena SWAN and received a Bronze Award in 2019.
All three departments run their own staff and student surveys to complement UCL-wide surveys;
we use these to gather information on points of concern and to target action plans.
Juno and Athena SWAN concentrate on action for gender equity. The current gender balance of
staff and students is shown in Table 2.

Table 2: gender distribution in staff and (research) student headcount across the UoA.

 Staff group                                Male     Female    Total    % Male     % Female
 Academic staff                               99       28        127     78.0%        22.0%
 Research staff                              128       31        159     80.5%        19.5%

                                              33       47        80      41.3%        58.8%

 Technical staff                              63        8        71      88.7%        11.3%


In the undergraduate intake, female students rose from 21% in 2012-13 to 32% in 2019-20; for
postgraduate research students they were 27% in 2019-20. Our senior female academics are role
models for gender equity: Nguyen won the flagship Rosalind Franklin Award from the Royal
Society in 2019, recognising an outstanding contribution to any STEM area and supporting the
promotion of women in STEM (our second winner, following the LCN’s McKendry, returned in
UoA1 in 2014).
We increasingly focus also on equity related to other protected characteristics; all three
departments have transformed their Athena SWAN/Juno working groups into broader Equality,
Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) committees. Of the 108 HESA 3 staff where data are available (84
male, 24 female), 86 identify as white and 15 as BME (13.9%) with 7 identifications unknown; the
corresponding numbers for 115 HESA 2 staff are 82 white and 15 BME (13.0%), with 14
identifications unknown and 4 withheld. Approximately 2% of our HESA 2 staff and none of our
HESA 3 staff are known to identify as disabled. Our research student intake identifying as ‘non-
white’ rose from 22% in 2013-14 to 39% in 2019-20.
We are keenly aware that physics (at UCL, as elsewhere) remains predominantly white and male;
while working to change this, we recognise this is a long-term project and in the meantime we must
make the environment a welcoming one for women and other currently under-represented groups.
We recognise challenges can arise in academic environments through power imbalances in close
working relationships (e.g. between senior staff and junior staff or students), and UCL was the first
Russell Group university to ban personal relationships between staff and students for whom they
are directly responsible. We are proud of the work done by our staff to highlight equalities: for
example, P&A is currently led by its first BME Head, who is also a member of the UCL-wide
Equality Charters Group, and a Professor from P&A is the MAPS Faculty’s first Vice-Dean for EDI.
UCL has a consciously welcoming attitude to LGBTQ+ staff and students, and was proud to be
among the Stonewall Top 100 Employers in 2018 (the only UK university to earn a place while
having both an Athena SWAN silver institutional award and a Race Equality Charter Mark).
Members of P&A proposed a high-level UCL Preventing Sexual Misconduct Strategy Group, which
led to improvements in culture across UCL. They were instrumental in delivering an institution-wide
‘Report + Support’ tool, launched in February 2019, which reformed how reports are handled,
                                                                                            Page 13
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
removing barriers (allowing anonymous reporting where necessary) and providing improved
support. We enthusiastically embrace the ‘Where Do You Draw the Line?’ workshops, co-
developed by UCL with Cambridge, Manchester and Oxford, that focus on the boundaries between
acceptable and unacceptable behaviour in academic contexts and encourage a culture of active
by-standing; we run sessions in all three departments (9 since 2017) co-facilitated by the HoDs
and UCL’s EDI team. Supplementary Taking the Lead workshops target staff with leadership
responsibilities, focussing on effective interventions and creating a positive environment.


2.2 Staffing strategy
2.2.1 Academic staff
We appoint our academic staff on the basis of open, international searches with the widest
possible reach. Recognising that the primary limit on our appointment of currently under-
represented groups is the numbers who apply, our practice is actively to reach out to individuals
within these groups and encourage applications. The vast majority of first-choice applicants accept
our offers (18 out of 19 advertised posts appointed to in the review period, plus all three appointed
subsequently). Long-term fellowships (particularly from UKRI, Research Councils, and the Royal
Society) provide an important route to academic posts; where a fellow works in an area with a
strategic need for an academic appointment, they may be interviewed for a proleptic appointment
with the same criteria as an open competition. We hosted 40 long-term (5 years +) career
development fellows during the REF period; of these, 27 now have academic or proleptic
appointments at UCL, and 9 moved to academic research/teaching appointments elsewhere.
Of the 110.5 FTE staff returned in REF2014, 25 have left (not all full time): 7 retirements, 7 to
positions at other UK universities, 2 to UK industry or national laboratories, 8 to international
positions (one continues part-time at UCL), one death. We have made 21 new full-time
appointments and now return 112.5 FTE. Two recruitments were interrupted by the Covid-19
pandemic; UCL re-started these to sustain long-term investments in key areas (biological physics,
experimental condensed matter) although the start dates now fall after the REF census date.
Annual appraisals encourage career development and support staff to apply for promotion when
ready; 79 academic promotions occurred during the period (43 to Reader/Associate Professor and
36 to Professor), including 20 female promotions (24% of all senior promotions and 100% of
female candidates put forward). From 2018 the grades of Senior Lecturer and Reader were
combined into Associate Professor, but staff could retain previous designations.
All academic staff are expected to be both teachers and researchers unless bought out by external
funds. The teaching departments (P&A and SCP) have formal workload management systems;
probationary staff carry a reduced load, and we also make reductions in recognition of particular
personal circumstances. Increased flexibility has been afforded over the period by the
appointment of a cohort of dedicated Teaching Fellows (now 7.8 FTE, with career grades of
Lecturer, Associate Professor and Professor (Teaching)), providing leadership in teaching practice
and taking around 20% of the undergraduate teaching load.
2.2.2 Research and support staff
Our postdoctoral research, technical support and engineering staff are critical: we currently have
159 postdoctoral and 169 support staff (the LCN total includes all supporting physics-related
research there – some also support other UoAs). We see career development of both groups as
an important responsibility; they have the opportunity to select a mentor separate from their line
manager for broader career development. Annual appraisals ensure regular reviews of progress
and opportunities and we systematically encourage postdoctoral staff to consider submitting
fellowship applications. UCL fully implements the Concordat to support Career Development of
Researchers, and postdoctoral researchers are employed on open-ended contracts. Research
staff are encouraged to apply for promotion through UCL’s careers framework: 13 were promoted
to Senior Research Associate/Fellow (77%:23% male:female), and 5 to Principal or Professorial
Research Associate/Fellow over the period.



                                                                                            Page 14
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
We support the development of ‘communities of practice’ linking technical and IT staff across UCL;
several of our staff are group coordinators. Technical staff have the opportunity to transfer to
research roles where appropriate, providing further opportunities for promotion.
2.2.3 Staff development and recognition
All new staff have a probationary period: three years for academic staff (unless they have
substantial teaching experience) and nine months otherwise. Regular meetings with the line
manager ensure that probationary objectives are met; new academic staff are assigned a mentor
(usually a senior academic from the same research group) to help with initial familiarisation,
establish departmental connections and support career development (including advice on teaching
and grant funding).
UCL offers a comprehensive programme of staff development (see REF5a). We encourage staff
to take advantage of these opportunities and to undertake roles that will further their careers.
UCL’s Academic Promotions Framework (for academic and research staff) provides expectations
across research, teaching, impact and institutional citizenship. All non-Professorial academic staff
are considered for promotion annually against these criteria. Staff in research environments
frequently go beyond their formal job requirements, and all three departments have award
schemes to recognise these contributions.
2.2.4 Leave and part-time working
We enthusiastically implement UCL’s policies on parental leave, carers’ leave, and requests for
part-time working, and see this as an important mechanism to retain skilled staff with family
responsibilities. 5 of our staff have taken shared parental leave during the period (including senior
academic staff) and we make extensive use of part-time and flexible working (e.g. >50 SCP staff).
2.2.5 Returners
All three departments support staff returning from periods of leave to travel or receive training, and
academic staff are given one year free of administrative and teaching commitments to re-establish
their research.
2.2.6 Sabbatical leave
UCL offers academic staff opportunities to apply for sabbatical leave for (one term for every three
years of service), and 29 staff have taken a sabbatical during the period, with 18 spending time at
an international institution. We use sabbaticals strategically to refresh our portfolio in the light of
international developments and many staff have identified opportunities in new areas. For
example, A Green developed new topics at the interface between many-body quantum physics
and machine learning, Doel focused on the delivery of the 4MOST spectrograph, Hoogenboom
shifted his biophysics research towards immunology, and Thorne incorporated electroweak
corrections into parton distributions (underpinning the forthcoming definitive ‘global fit’ of the
standard model).
2.3 Our students and research training
Our most important legacy is the scientists we train. ‘Integration of Research and Education’ is a
theme of UCL’s 2034 strategy, and we make it a priority to develop research culture in all students,
undergraduate and postgraduate. During the period, 442 students obtained undergraduate
Masters (MSci) degrees in physics-related disciplines, and 592 MSc degrees; all these carry out a
significant research project (nominally 300 hours for the MSci, 600 hours for the MSc).
Research students are initially registered for the MPhil, and normally transfer to PhD registration
early in their second year of research after writing a report and defending it at interview with a
supervisory panel. With recruitment to our recently funded CDTs the total number of research
students is currently 329, and 350 PhD degrees were awarded in the period (50 per year, up from
33 in REF2014); we moved from 3-year to 4-year PhD funding over the period and >90% of PhD
theses are submitted within five years (based on the four most recent cohorts for which data are
available). An electronic logbook system tracks supervisor engagement, completion of training
courses, and overall progress.


                                                                                                Page 15

2.3.1 Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs) and doctoral training partnerships
UCL was an early and enthusiastic proponent of centres for doctoral training (CDTs), especially
where there is a large concentration of research in one location, because of the benefits to
students of a cohort-centred approach. P&A and LCN host the EPSRC CDT in Delivering
Quantum Technologies (awarded 2014, renewed 2019), and our joint CDT in Data Intensive
Science (P&A and SCP) was top-ranked in the inaugural STFC competition (2017) and A-ranked in
the review (2019). Both cohorts undertake general study aimed at acquiring both transferable
research skills and specialist (often interdisciplinary) knowledge relevant to their field, then pursue
a PhD programme in one of the participating research groups, benefiting throughout from whole-
cohort training activities, support and collaborative networks.
We also host student projects from other EPSRC CDTs, notably Advanced Characterisation of
Materials (held within the LCN, jointly between Imperial and UCL, awarded 2014 and renewed
2019), and M3S (Molecular Modelling and Materials Science, held in UCL Chemistry, awarded
2009 and renewed 2014). Our staff are involved in the supervisory pool for the NERC London
Doctoral Training Partnership, whose themes include atmospheric and ocean processes,
environmental physics and mathematical modelling. In total 114 students from these CDTs or
partnerships embarked on research degrees with physics supervisors during the period, and 63 of
our Category A staff are members of the supervisory pools for one or more of these centres.
Training innovations introduced through the CDTs included: a ‘mystery sample challenge’,
research case studies surveying open problems in rapidly developing areas, case studies on start-
ups in quantum technologies, the opportunity to pitch to a panel including venture capital
representatives for commercialisation funding, presentation skills training incorporating lessons
from the performing arts, and group research projects addressing challenges presented by
partners. The first-ever STFC Machine Learning Summer School was organised at UCL in
2018, attended by ~120 students from across the UK, with much of the training delivered by
industry partners. These programmes have been particularly successful at bringing commercial
and government partners to work with our students through placement opportunities and the
provision of joint training. All the students on our CDT in Data Intensive Science have joint
projects with partners, and over 30 students and PDRAs have undertaken placements with
partners since 2017. Partners include Intel, ASOS, Mellanox Technologies, Faculty AI, The
Economist, UKAEA, TfL, Babylon Health, Hitachi, NPL, DSTL, Joint Biosecurity Centre, Keysight,
Siemens, BT, Huawei and Google.
2.3.2 Other student-centred training activities
Building on the success of our CDTs, we take an increasingly cohort-centred approach to research
student training across the rest of our portfolio. We provide subject-specific advanced research
training to appropriate groups of students:
      A high-level course on materials modelling, run through the Thomas Young Centre and
       including material on electronic structure techniques as well as a range of classical
       simulation methods;
      Advanced training in particle physics, including software carpentry, computing and
       statistics, an in-depth survey of the standard model, and advanced topics including detector
       techniques, neutrino physics, dark matter, and detector technologies;
      Training courses in high-performance computing, numerical methods, and software
       engineering (including peer-led courses in Python and C++ funded by the departments).
We also promote transferable skills including communication skills and groupwork, for example
through a regular student-organised retreat at Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park for
students and early-career researchers in quantum technology and quantum physics (Qcumber – 5
held during the REF period), and through an annual 2-day Hackathon for students in physics and
related quantitative subjects. Commercial participants as sponsors or judges have included
Deloitte Digital, Quantcast and ASI Data Science (now Faculty AI) - one of London’s leading
machine learning consultancies, founded in 2014 by our former students and typifying the benefits
of this approach.


                                                                                              Page 16
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
2.3.3 Entrepreneurship for early-career researchers
We also follow up our placement opportunities and training with subject-specific schemes to
promote entrepreneurship among early-career researchers. 31 of our students benefited from the
first year of the new SPERO entrepreneurship programme run by UCL Innovation and Enterprise
in 2019-20.

Additionally, UCLQ Innovation Fellowships support UCL researchers (postgraduate or
postdoctoral) bringing a quantum technology to the protype stage before seeking licensing
opportunities or venture capital funding. Projects funded by the scheme include new robust
accelerometers based on levitated nanoparticles (the inventor also holds an RAEng Postdoctoral
Fellowship) and a novel design of superconducting qubit.
2.4 Our people during the Covid-19 pandemic
Regular meetings and briefings from the Heads and Dean kept staff and students informed. We
spoke openly about the challenges of remote working and made flexibility a priority for those with
caring responsibilities. We reopened research facilities wherever possible consistent with staff and
student safety (see §3.3) and supported students to apply for funding extensions where needed;
UCL provided 3-month extensions for all funded final-year PhD students and increased its hardship
fund to £3K per individual. We invested heavily in tools for online collaboration and remote control
of experiments, purchased additional software licenses for those who cannot perform experiments,
and shipped furniture and equipment to those working at home. We continued to run programmes
of seminars and group meetings and seized the opportunity to invite speakers from distant
locations. We have used always-open Zoom rooms and ‘virtual coffee’ to maintain informal contact
with staff and students.


 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities

3.1 Income
Research income is £162.3M over the REF period (£23.2M per year, up from £18M per year in
REF2014). UKRI and the research councils (including the Royal Society) are our most important
funders (£108.5M), with STFC contributing £66.3M and EPSRC £28.8M; EU government bodies
(including the ERC) contributed £31.1M and charities £3.7M. Research income in kind from the
use of research facilities supported by UKRI is £82.8M, including £58.0M for particle physics,
£15.7M for condensed-matter and optical sciences, £6.5M for telescope access (ground-based
and satellite-borne), and £2.6M for computing (see summary in Table 3).
Table 3: summary of income in kind from use of UKRI- and UKSA-supported facilities.

 Ground-based telescopes (e.g. ALMA, eMERLIN, ESO, William
 Herschel and Isaac Newton telescopes)                                 £4,153,275
 Space-based telescopes (e.g. XMM-Newton, Hubble)                      £2,371,340
 Particle physics (CERN, T2K, LT)                                     £57,954,165
 Condensed-matter and optical science (Diamond, ESRF and
 XMaS, ILL, ISIS, European XFEL, Central Laser Facility, EMFL)        £15,727,162
 Computing (Dirac, ARCHER Materials Chemistry, UKAMOR and
 UKCP consortia)                                                       £2,628,633
 TOTAL                                                                £82,834,574


In addition, we are substantial users of non-UKRI resources, through our success in international
calls and participation in international collaborations. Examples (with estimated values) include:
Keck 10m telescope (14.5 nights, ~£550k), additional Hubble time via US grant (64 orbits,

                                                                                           Page 17
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
~£300k), Advanced Photon Source, USA (£2M), Pohang Light Source, China (£300k), SCALA X-
FEL, Japan (£300k), Azure cloud computing (~£70k).
3.1.1 Research funding strategy
We have a comprehensive strategy in place to support research funding applications. A
specialised team of Research Facilitators operates across the BEAMS School, who send a
monthly newsletter identifying calls, celebrating successes and organising mock interviews for
major grants and fellowships. Departments provide mentoring of early-career staff and review of
their applications by senior colleagues, and targeted use of UCL and RCIF funds to support
strategic equipment items (especially those with a wide user base). UCL’s success in inter-
disciplinary projects is underpinned by a pan-institutional set of Grand Challenges and Research
Domains.
3.1.2 Personal grants and fellowships
An important indicator of our research vibrancy is success in highly competitive fellowships or
personal grants from the European Research Council, UKRI and its member councils, and the
Royal Society. During the review period our staff held seven ERC Advanced grants, six
Consolidator grants and five Starting grants – see Table 4. They also held 23 Royal Society URFs,
12 STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellowships and 3 other STFC Fellowships, 11 EPSRC Fellowships,
plus a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship and Hawking Fellowship – see Table 5. Thomas won a
Royal Society Research Professorship in 2020.

3.2 Infrastructure and facilities
Total expenditure in the three departments on equipment in the period was £47.7M (£6.8M per
year – LCN spend benefits all disciplines represented there, not only physics); of this, £37.0M was
from external grants, £5.5M from UCL’s core funds, and £5.1M from other activities (e.g. facilities
income). UCL invested £9.4M from its capital programme in estates projects wholly or largely
benefiting physics research, including major laboratory refurbishments, and facility upgrades at
both LCN and MSSL, plus a further £53M in two large campus projects with significant benefit to
physics (refurbishment of the Kathleen Lonsdale Building and the Wilkins Terrace adjacent to the
Physics Building).
3.2.1 Computing facilities and support
UCL hosts the national Tier 2 computing hub for Materials and Molecular Modelling (£4M EPSRC
investment in 2016, a further £4.5M from 2019 – UCL committed £600k running costs plus >7 FTE
years staff time); this project currently supports Thomas (~17,000 cores, 88TB RAM) and its
replacement Young (23,000 cores, 116 TB RAM). The project is led from the CMMP group in P&A
and closely associated with the Thomas Young Centre. A further machine Michael (project led
from UCL Chemistry) provides >8000 cores and ~40 TB RAM dedicated to the battery materials
work of the Faraday Institution. The DiRAC supercomputing initiative (originally UCL-led) is now
supported by STFC as a national facility, with the project office based in UCL.
Physics researchers are among the largest users of UCL’s central compute platforms: Grace
(10400 cores, 40TB RAM with a high-bandwidth Infiniband connection, intended for large
multimode parallel jobs) and its replacement Kathleen (7680 cores, 36TB RAM), and Myriad (a
high-throughput cluster including GPUs for shared-memory jobs and data science, with 3816 cores
and 31TB RAM), and the central Research Data Storage service. Additionally, during the earlier
part of the period we benefited from Legion (a general-use cluster with 5800 cores), and shared
access to Emerald, a GPU system hosted by STFC for the Science and Engineering South
consortium. Smaller-scale departmental facilities include dedicated clusters for particle physics,
astrophysics, cosmology, biological physics and materials simulation; these were refreshed with
£140k of UCL RCIF investment during the period and currently total >6000 cores with 30TB RAM.
All three departments have research computing staff (12 FTE in all) who manage local systems
and supply subject-specialist support; they complement UCL’s central team, which includes a
highly regarded Research Software Development Group (founded in 2012 as the first of its kind,
now with 24 software engineers) providing support to individual projects and key training including
an MSc-level course in research software engineering taken by >1000 staff and students.
3.2.2 Nanoscience, nanofabrication and quantum technologies
Several major equipment upgrades provided testbeds for quantum devices and improved our
nanofabrication facilities. The largest came from the multi-institutional QUES2T initiative, led from
UCL, in the National Quantum Technologies Programme capital call. This brought three new
dilution refrigerators and a low temperature scanning probe system to the LCN, plus major
upgrades to electron beam lithography and a new furnace for silicon devices. This £6M equipment
investment at UCL was accompanied by a £3.2M estates project (UCL-funded) to enhance the
LCN cleanroom (ISO6) and refurbish laboratories for the equipment. This project was associated
with new laboratories for work on piezoelectric materials and negative capacitance, and for X-ray
scattering, and an upgrade to the Optical Sciences Laboratory underpinning contributions to DESI
and the 4MOST instrument at ESO (UCL investment £368k). Further quantum technology
testbeds were funded by the ERC and through the Quantum Computing and Simulation Hub. We
also upgraded the LCN’s equipment in bio-nanoscience with new Atomic Force Microscopes, and
a new LCN-led super-resolution fluorescence microscope.



                                                                                            Page 19
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
3.2.3 Dark-matter searches
We have established a new mass spectrometry laboratory to support dark-matter searches, with
£200k of RCIF funding; it has world-leading sensitivity to uranium and thorium as well as other
isotopes relevant to low-background experiments. As well as dark matter searches, applications
include the LEGEND neutrino mass experiment and detection of trace contaminants in drinking
water.
3.2.4 Space science
UCL invested £150k in facilities at MSSL for assembly and testing of space instrumentation for
ESA, NASA and JAXA missions. They now include 11 test chambers for vacuum testing,
outgassing and contamination control, and two cleanrooms (ISO6 and ISO8). The facility includes
CAD design, thermal analysis, sheet metal forming and electrical discharge machining, optical and
plasma calibration; it is extensively used by external customers, including universities and
commercial organizations. In addition, we have invested in space for Ariel mission coordination
and the CSED at Harwell.
3.2.5 Workshops
Fulfilling a target in the last REF, we combined the MAPS Faculty workshop with the Biochemical
and Chemical Engineering workshop to produce a single, state-of-the-art mechanical workshop for
the BEAMS school with greater throughput and an operating budget >£400k pa. The larger user
base has enabled significant capital investments (including £43k from P&A for a new computer-
controlled machine. The facility is now equipped with modern machinery and infrastructure for
design and delivery of complex components.
3.2.6 New laser laboratories and optical spectroscopy tools
The space vacated by the workshop rationalisation was developed into a new Photon Science
Hub, including two quantum measurement laboratories for P&A, with investment by UCL of £3.8M.
We also invested in a new optical frequency comb from UCL RCIF funds (£250k), which will be
fibre-linked to the new laboratories and will underpin future experiments in quantum sensing and
quantum optics, spectroscopy for exoplanet research, and table-top tests of physics beyond the
Standard Model.
3.2.7 New office and collaboration spaces
We relocated the Astrophysics group into the Lewis Building and NW Wing on the Bloomsbury
campus, two minutes’ walk from the Physics Building. We provided new office and collaboration
space for the core membership of the Cosmoparticle Initiative, as well as refurbishing space in the
Physics Building for our CDTs.
3.3 Our facilities in the context of Covid-19
UCL moved entirely to remote working in March 2020 at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. All
laboratories and experimental facilities were closed, with the exception of a very small number of
long-running experiments which could be managed remotely and some Covid-related research in
the LCN building. The Physics, LCN and MSSL buildings were among the first at UCL to reopen,
in July 2020; they have since operated with maximum 25% occupancy and 2m distancing. We
prioritise access to experiments and technical work that can only be done on-site; UCL policy is
that all meetings currently take place online.


 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society

4.1 London collaborations
London is a major scientific centre and a significant draw for international talent. Major learned
societies (including the Royal Society, Institute of Physics, Royal Astronomical Society)
accompany exceptional scientific universities (e.g. Imperial, King’s, QMUL) and research institutes
(National Physical Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute, Alan Turing Institute). We make full use of
this environment through the multi-university London Centre for Nanotechnology (with Imperial and
                                                                                           Page 20
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
King’s) and Thomas Young Centre (with Imperial, King’s and QMUL). The Institute for the Physics
of Living Systems links UCL with the Francis Crick Institute and we have links with Imperial, King’s,
Birkbeck, QMUL, and RHUL through our postgraduate training programmes; students from the DIS
CDT take placements at the Turing Institute. We see the ‘London factor’ as key to the formation of
partnerships; we have formed links with numerous London-based technology start-ups, helping
them to expand their businesses and improve their competitive position.
4.2 International institutional collaborations
UCL’s international strategy prioritises cross-institutional links with selected global partners,
alongside ‘bottom-up’ collaborations in individual subjects. Strategic partners in Physics include
Peking University (PKU) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in China, Yale University in the
US, the University of Toronto and McGill University in Canada, Tokyo Institute of Technology and
National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) in Japan, ASTAR in Singapore, and Seoul National
University in South Korea. UCL invested £114k in seed-corn funding for physics collaborations
during the period.
4.3 Collaborative research programmes
4.3.1 Formal collaborations
Especially in astrophysics, space science and particle physics, much of our work is structured
around large collaborations. These include DES*, DESI*, Euclid*, ALMA, Gaia*, Ariel*, PLATO*,
Comet Interceptor*, SMILE*, Exomars*, Solar Orbiter*, Hinode*, Cluster*, Lagrange*, Juice,
LEGEND, LISA, LSST, ATLAS*, MINOS+*, CHIPS*, ZEUS*, Super-NEMO*, ANITA, NOVA*, g-2*,
LUX-Zeplin*, AWAKE* and DUNE (* denotes major UCL PI/spokesperson or consortium-level
leadership role).
4.3.2 Informal collaborations
Outside these formal structures, collaborations are central to our scientific productivity. In total,
1459 different national and international partner universities appear in joint publications in the
review period. Over 6000 papers are joint with other UK institutions, over 4500 with US
institutions, and over 3000 each with France and Germany, and almost 2000 with China. 80% of
all our publications have at least one international co-author (still 68% excluding larger
collaborations with >15 authors).
4.4 Interactions with users, beneficiaries and audiences
We aim not just to do excellent physics but to ensure that we connect both with wider society and
with users of our research.
4.4.1 The general public
UCL is a public institution and the bulk of our research is publicly funded; therefore, we see a
responsibility to maintain a dialogue with the public (not just to ‘inform’ or ‘educate’ them). Our
central London location contributes significantly to our activities; the Ogden Trust has funded a
Physics Outreach Coordinator within UCL since 2017. L Green regularly presents The Sky at
Night on BBC1, Butterworth’s blog Life and Physics was hosted by The Guardian in 2010-2018
and had ~50,000 visitors per month in that time, Coates’ science articles on The Conversation
have >1.2M reads, and Bramwell has made three appearances on BBC Radio 4’s In Our Time.
Prinja’s Planetarium won both the American Institute of Physics Writing for Children Prize and the
Royal Society’s Young People’s Book Prize in 2019, while Butterworth’s Smashing Physics was
shortlisted for the 2015 Royal Society Winton Prize. We have led several competitively selected
exhibits at the annual Royal Society Summer Science Exhibitions, which typically attract 14,000+
visitors, including Quantum Biology (Olaya Castro) James Webb Space Telescope (Barlow),
Aurora Explorer (Fazakerley), Ice Worlds (G Jones) and A Comet Revealed (G Jones).
The UCL discovery of water in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b generated over 4000 media
reports in 2019 (based on >60 media interviews). The first reconstructed image of a black hole
(with UCL the only UK consortium member) attracted similar coverage, with Younsi’s television and
newspaper interviews reaching tens of millions, and >5 million views for videos featuring the work
of Wu and Younsi. The launch of Solar Orbiter in February 2020 generated numerous media

                                                                                              Page 21
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
appearances for Owen and Verscharen, with ESA ‘first light’ press and social media events
generating international interest and reaching 600 million individuals by traditional media (up to 3
billion via social media). Diego’s documentary Seven Ages of Starlight has been shown ten times,
and Olaya-Castro’s contribution to The Secrets of Quantum Physics eight times, on BBC4. Kitching
proposed and participated in the BBC’s The Mystery of Dark Energy which aired 7 times. Major
science-art collaborations have been initiated by Peiris, Ghag, Kitching, Hoogenboom and
Pontzen; our staff led a UCLQ quantum outreach day at Spitalfields Market and Ghag led the
establishment of Dark Matter Day as a regular STFC event in London. L Green and Pontzen serve
on the Advisory Panel for the Cheltenham Science Festival.
4.4.2 School and university students
Since 1997 P&A has hosted the UCL Science Centre, a weekly series of lectures targeted at sixth-
formers (30,000 student visits during the review period). Each year we give >30 schools talks,
organise regular Particle Physics masterclasses and events at the UCL Observatory in Mill Hill
reaching over 1000 school pupils, alongside training events for newly qualified physics teachers.
UCL’s 3-day fundamental science festival Your Universe, held in Bloomsbury since 2009,
celebrates particle physics and astronomy and generates a dialogue between the public and active
physicists; the 8 events during the period were attended by ~2400 school pupils (and 1400
members of the general public).
A major new initiative during the review period is ORBYTS (Original Research By Young Twinkle
Students). UCL early-career researchers visit schools and provide A-level students with university-
level physics skills to work on real research. Over 300 students from 22 schools participated in
2019-20 (over 50% eligible for free school meals). We also coordinate a ‘Hacking Science’ coding
project in Hackney schools and youth centres. Since 2017 UCLQ has organised a summer school
in quantum technologies, targeted especially at under-represented groups and those from
undergraduate backgrounds other than physics; >80 students benefited from this opportunity. SCP
run an annual “space science week” work experience programme for 35-50 A-level students from
diverse backgrounds and a 50:50 gender balance, with support from UCLs Widening Participation
scheme.
4.4.3 Commercial and government beneficiaries
In addition to the examples in Impact Case Studies, and the training engagement through CDTs,
Howard, Skipper and collaborators licensed their nano-inks technology to Linde, while UCLQ ran a
series of quantum industry days in central London featuring quantum technologies across UCL.
We ran professional development activities in systems engineering and project management
(beneficiaries included Airbus, ESA, e2V) and also in quantum technologies (Santander). We led
TYC seminars given to BP during 2019 through an Innovate UK project and established
collaborations in electronic materials with Infineon Technologies and Applied Materials Inc. Our
spin-out SpaceFlux facilitates big data analytics for space-based applications. Our collaboration
with the Meteorological Office on space weather, and the success of the physics-based startup
Quantemol Ltd, are described in Impact Case Studies.
4.5 Contributions to the research base
Our researchers published 7,968 papers during the review period; by the submission date these
had been cited 230,803 times, with an h-index of 172. Of these, 425 (5.33%) were in the top 1%
for citations based on their subject category, year, and document type.
4.5.1 Leadership of conferences and research training schools
Our staff were leads or organisers of more than 135 national and international conferences,
including membership of the organising committee for ICHEP (Konstantinidis). We gave over 500
invited talks in the UK and over 1100 internationally, including major plenary/highlight talks at: APS
April Meeting (Feeney); Solvay Conference 2015 (Ellis); COSMO-14 and COSMO-18, Texas
Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics (Peiris); EWASS (Saintonge, Savini); IAU General

fields. Saakyan co-authored the double beta decay report for the Astro-particle Physics European
Consortium (APPEC) and Lahav sits on its advisory committee, Waters is a member of the STFC
UK Dark matter review, Coates, Lahav and McMorrow have all sat on the STFC Science Board,
Butterworth was a member of the UK CERN committee and of the European Particle Physics
Strategy Group. Peiris is a member of STFC Council (Butterworth will join in 2021). Fisher was a
member of the EPSRC Physical Sciences SAT, McMorrow chairs the Scientific Advisory
Committee for ESRF. Further details are given in Table 7.
4.5.3 Named lectures
Named lectures included the Carnegie Centennial Lecture at St Andrews and the Brinson Lecture
at Chicago (Ellis), the Svein Rosseland Lecture in Oslo (Peiris), and the Gordon Lecture at Cornell
(Saintonge); in 2020, all three of the RAS named lectures were given by UCL researchers (Darwin
Lecture – Lahav, Whitrow Lecture – Pontzen, Dungey Lecture – Matthews). The Whitrow and
Dungey lecturers in 2014 and 2017 were Lahav and Owen.
4.5.4 Awards, fellowships and prizes
Our staff have won highly competitive fellowships from major funders, including ERC, EPSRC,
STFC, UKRI and the Royal Society (see Table 4, Table 5); Thomas recently won a highly
prestigious Royal Society Research Professorship. Ellis, Tennyson, and Thomas (elected 2017)
are Fellows of the Royal Society (FRS). Major awards to UoA staff are shown in Table 6. In
addition, Sir Michael Pepper FRS (returned in UoA12, joint appointment in LCN) won the 2019
Newton Medal and Prize of the IoP – the Institute’s premier award, and a significant additional
indicator of our environment’s vitality. Ellis and Michaelides were named in the Clarivate
international ‘highly cited researchers’ list for 2019, and Thorne is the senior of three authors for
the authoritative ‘structure functions’ section of the biennial Review of Particle Physics. Bramwell
was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of Uppsala.

4.6 Conclusion
The awards won by our researchers are a tribute to the role UCL is playing in the development of
modern physics. The leadership by our senior staff is broad and extends across the whole subject.
UCL’s collaborative and informal ethos helps this to translate to an exceptional environment for our
students and early-career staff. That environment is geared to what they will achieve next.
