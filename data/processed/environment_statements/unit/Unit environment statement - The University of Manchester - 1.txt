 Unit of Assessment: UoA1 (Clinical Medicine)

 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy

 UoA1 in the University of Manchester (UoM) covers the research of 222.06 FTE academics
 working in 12 multidisciplinary research groups. Our research spans the “discovery-to-translation”
 spectrum, and embraces biomarker discovery and exploitation, trans-disciplinary regenerative
 medicine, and medical humanities. During REF2021, we have made discoveries that have proved
 life-changing for patients with cancer, cardiovascular, developmental, genetic and inflammatory
 diseases (1.6) and have led to adoption of new approaches to care in the NHS (1.2).
 Global research impact and reach is enhanced by our collaborative environment (1.1.1B)
 incorporating: UoM’s rich cross-cutting infrastructure that concentrates skills and resource in open-
 access Institutes, available to us for specialist assistance and advancement of research; our broad
 and diverse researcher groups across the world; and our industry partners.
 An overview of UoA1 is provided in Sections: 1.1: Research Strategy; 1.2: Headline impact; 1.3:
 Future direction; and 1.4: Unit structure/context, and is elaborated on elsewhere in the return.

 1.1 UoA1’s Research strategy
 During the REF2021 period we have refined our REF2014 statement “Our aim is to translate basic
 biomedical discoveries into effective diagnostics and therapies” into a strategy to generate
 research of international excellence and impact), aligned to three major challenges:
  Discovering novel disease mechanisms
  Developing new approaches to prevention and early detection of disease
  Taking into clinical practice next-generation, person-centred therapies, interventions and care
   pathways based on robust, peer-reviewed evidence available for general scrutiny
 We are achieving our strategy by implementing programmes that build on our research strengths,
 enhance partnership and stakeholder engagement, and nurture staff.

 1.1.1 Three major principles underpin delivery of our strategy:
 A. Greater Manchester’s unique healthcare environment as a research platform
 The challenges of our health-disadvantaged community (4.2) led Central Government in 2014 to
 devolve the £6.2bn/year health and care budget (DevoManc) to Greater Manchester (GM) Health
 and Social Care Partnership (GMHSCP), with UoM as lead academic partner.
 GMHSCP has transformed GM’s clinical landscape. Supported by pioneering centralised
 electronic patient record systems, it has established “One Manchester Healthcare” unifying
 delivery across our primary and secondary healthcare sectors (population 2.8m), and co-ordinated
 tertiary provision reaching up to 6m people depending on specialty.
 Recognising how research drives health improvement and innovation, in 2017 GMHSCP formed
 Health Innovation Manchester (HInM, Academic Lead Bruce). HInM oversees the activities of
 Manchester’s Academic Health Science Centre (MAHSC, 1.5 [UoM core academic partner,
 Executive Director Lord]) and the Academic Health Science Network, enabling synchronous roll-
 out of clinical research, and accelerating clinical application of new treatments and tests across
 GM’s entire health ecosystem. Within this environment we have built a robust, specialty-agnostic

                                                                                               Page 1
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 infrastructure to underpin our research by ensuring re-designation of MAHSC in 2020 and winning
 NIHR funding for the Manchester Biomedical Research Centre (3.2.1, BRC: £28.5m), Applied
 Research Collaboration (ARC-GM: £11.3m), Manchester Clinical Research Facility (3.7, MCRF:
 £12.5m), GM Local Clinical Research Network (LCRN: £22m) and GM Patient Safety Translational
 Research Centre (PSTRC: £6.7m: one of 3 nationally).
 Through GM’s delivery of consolidated healthcare, the co-ordinated research and clinical
 infrastructure and access to a population of 2.8m and their e-records, this environment offers us
 a unique test bed. It is a microcosm of global health systems allowing outcomes to be tracked
 against interventions in all major disease areas. As such it empowers: pull-through of UoA1’s
 basic discoveries to clinical translation at scale; and generation of powered, evidenced research,
 thus advancing our agenda of internationally-relevant healthcare research.
 Additionally, our research base within a health disadvantaged population, allows us to generate
 research that is directly transferable to similar conurbations globally, a pillar of our social
 responsibility agenda.

 B. Turning innovative ideas into clinical value by effective partnering
 Within UoM: As part of a 2016 research-focused restructure, UoM merged two of its four Faculties
 (“Life Sciences”; “Medicine and Health”) into the Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health (FBMH),
 integrating research at the discovery/experimental medicine interface through multidisciplinary
 Research Groups.
 Across all its scholarship UoM has formed (REF5a.2iii) five “Research Beacons” (4.1.1), examples
 of outstanding interdisciplinary, pioneering, cross-sector partnerships tackling some of the biggest
 questions facing the planet; and 26 “Research Institutes and Platforms”, that combine disciplines
 and capabilities, allowing flexibility and delivering research impact in response to contemporary
 challenges (4.1.2). For instance, as our research is increasingly reliant on analysis of large
 datasets, we access dedicated specialist skills and resource from the Institute for Data Science
 and Artificial Intelligence (IDSAI).
 Our researchers lead one Beacon (Cancer), and two Institutes (CRUK Manchester Institute
 [CRUK-MI]; Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation [LBIII]); and are integrated
 into two Beacons (Advanced Materials, Global Inequalities), and seven Institutes/Platforms (Henry
 Royce Institute for Advanced Materials (Royce Institute), Manchester Institute for Collaborative
 Research on Ageing (MICRA), Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (MIB), Christabel Pankhurst
 Institute for Health Technology (Pankhurst Institute), Digital Futures, Health Policy and
 Organisation (IHPO), Policy@Manchester).
 These internal collaborations are particularly important in allowing us to harness advanced,
 innovative technologies to solve clinical problems.
 Outside UoM: Our research culture values external collaborations with Universities and Health
 Research Institutions (4.6), patient organisations (4.3), and industry (4.4).
 As an example of the extent of our collaborations, during REF2021, of our 5,836 primary peer-
 reviewed publications in Scopus listed journals, ~62% have been published in collaboration with
 academics and clinicians from 2,792 institutions in 122 countries, who bring to our research:
 authoritative international expertise; larger patient cohorts for rare diseases, specific treatments,
 complications and co-morbidities than even our population allows; and extended research skills,
 knowledge, infrastructure and funding, to bear on globally important clinical questions.
 Figure 1 illustrates the reach of our international research collaborations.


                                                                                               Page 2
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)




 C. Fostering research talent and attracting excellent researchers to Manchester
 The vitality of our research has been maintained through targeted recruitment and promotion.
 During REF2021, of the 236 independent researchers returned: 23% were external appointments
 to targeted prestigious fellowships (2.9) or directly to academic posts (2.8); 24% were promoted
 (12% to Professor, 4% to Readerships and 8% to Senior Lectureships); 17% are early career
 researchers (ECRs).
 We foster nascent research talent through our PhD (998 students currently), internal fellowship
 (8), and Academic Clinical Lecturer (ACLs: 22) schemes (2.4) which offer robust, supportive
 training and mentoring to doctoral students ECRs.

 1.2 Headline impact
 UoM’s institutional statement (REF5a.2) outlines the university’s focus on impact. In the 2018
 University Impact Rankings UoM was ranked first in Europe. UoA1’s research strategy is aligned
 with UoM’s. Evidence of national and international impact across REF2021 is evidenced
 throughout this document. Headline examples include:
 Our 11 REF3 Impact Cases (IC) spotlight established and ongoing clinical and economic impact
 covering rare genetic disorders, stillbirth, respiratory diseases, acute coronary syndromes and
 some cancers. When collated, the ICs identify the following health and economic impacts (IC
 exemplars given by author):
    International Impact:
      International roll-out of 10 novel diagnostic/prognostic tests (e.g. VitaloJAK: chronic cough
       [Smith]); four new radiotherapy regimes (e.g. Small cell lung cancer. [Faivre-Finn]); and
       seven new therapies (e.g. Brentuximab vedotin in Hodgkin lymphoma [Radford]).

                                                                                             Page 3
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
      Therapeutics introduced worldwide (e.g. Voriconazole gaining WHO “Essential Medicine”
       status for Aspergillosis in 2017 [Denning])
      Changed clinical guidance in the UK, across Europe, USA, Canada, China, Japan,
       Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, India and WHO. (Pan-European Lung Health Checks
       guidance [P.Crosbie])
    International/National impact
      Industry partners’ revenue increased by >£900m/year (e.g. Biomarin: Vimizim sales for
       Morquio-A increased by $140m/year between 2017 and 2019 [Bigger])
      Potential benefit to ~440,000 UK patients/year and >40m globally/year (e.g. Blood
       eosinophil-guided treatment reduces acute exacerbations of COPD [global incidence
       250m] by ~15% [Woodcock, Singh])
    National impact
      Potential NHS savings of ~£850m/year (e.g. 1-hour algorithm saves £2,000/patient with
       suspected acute coronary syndrome [Body])
 Publications selected for REF2 illustrate preclinical/clinical research impact. Some appear in 1.6
 contextualising discovery and impact by individual Research Group.
 As markers of research funders’/peer reviewers’ assessment of previous and future research
 impact, since REF2014 we have been awarded 13 new externally funded Research Centres
 (MRC, CRUK, NIHR, BHF. ~£150m. 3.2.1) and seen eight existing research Centres refunded
 through infrastructure, programme and project grants (~£100m. 3.2.2)
 During REF2021 our research has leveraged NHS/NIHR resource to establish another seven
 NHS-embedded integrated Treatment and Research Centres led by UoA1 clinical academics:
   2014: CRUK Major Cancer Centre. (Bristow £35m: Christie Hospital: 10,000 new patients/yr)
   2015: Hyperacute Stroke Centre. (Smith Royal Salford NHS Trust: ~2,000 patients/year)
   2015: Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine (Newman MCGM: serves tertiary population
    of 3.5m)
   2017: Manchester Heart Centre (>10,000 new patients/year), incorporating: Acute Cardiac
    Centre (Body); BHF Centre for Magnetic Resonance Research (BCMRR) (Miller/Naish)
   2018: Christie Hospital NHS/NIHR £105m Proton Beam Therapy Centre (Kirkby)
   2019: NIHR £4.4m Centre for Combatting Antimicrobial Resistance (Felton)
 We have developed robust collaborations. See Figure 1 and Section 4, demonstrating
 collaboration within UoM (4.1), with our NHS partners (4.2), patient/carer groups (4.3), and
 industry (4.4), spotlighting collaborative publications and research grants (4.6).
 Our Medical Humanities Group (1.6.12): has informed the dialogue between the NHS and the
 public around responsibility for, and delivery of, “care”; examined the rich history of black and
 minority ethnic staff in the NHS; and is changing perceptions of animals in healthcare research
 through the Wellcome Animal Research Nexus.
 We have identified value in novel diagnostics and therapeutics through studies sponsored by
 UK and international industry partners (£60m, 3.1),
 1.3 Future research direction and strategy for impact
 Our future research strategy develops evidenced successes during REF2021, and will continue
 to deliver impact through the future research aspirations of our Research Groups (see Future
 research in each of sections 1.6.1-1.6.12).

                                                                                            Page 4
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 We will build on the three principles underpinning our research strategy, using UoA1’s research
 and researchers to collaborate with colleagues in UoM’s Beacons and Institutes to develop novel
 solutions to key clinical questions; work with our research support infrastructure, to ensure we
 generate the funding needed for our academics to continue accessing high quality infrastructure
 and research staff; generate outputs and ideas with the quality to consolidate national/international
 collaborations; and develop our workforce.
 Covid-19 has emphasised the need to further develop our research in two specific areas:
  Directing research to address inequality in health and healthcare delivery in: The UK,
   supporting GMHSCP’s local agenda (4.2), whilst generating research transferrable to equally
   health-disadvantaged communities world-wide; Low-income countries through evidenced
   healthcare education (Research in Medical Education Group 1.6.12); UKRI Global Challenges
   Research funding in Cardiovascular Disease (1.6.2); ESRC “Genetics for Africa” funding
   (1.6.4), and our Aspergillosis research which has global reach (1.6.9).
  Improving responsiveness to future SARS-associated coronavirus epidemics building on
   the research initiatives described in 1.10.

 1.4 Unit Context and Structure
 UoA1 undertakes research within UoM’s strategic research environment (REF5a.2). The
 structures put in place at Faculty merger facilitate interdisciplinary science. Whilst day-to-day
 management of academic staff and students is within Schools (Biological Sciences [SBS], Medical
 Sciences [SMS], and Health Sciences [SHS]), and Divisions (Figure 2), research is focused on
 trans-disciplinary Research Groups.
 UoA1’s submission covers twelve Research Groups each spanning discovery to translation,
 with a shared goal of improving patient outcomes. All 236 independent researchers are returned
 (222.06 FTE). We cluster the Groups by research focus: Specific disease/system (four groups),
 Inflammation-focused (five groups), Applied technology (two groups) and Medical Humanities (one
 group) as follows:
 Specific disease type/system:
   Cancer (Cancer: Bristow)
   Cardiovascular Sciences (CVS: Keavney)
   Developmental Biology and Medicine (DBM: Heazell)
   Genetics and Genomics (Genetics: Newman)
 Inflammation:
   Manchester Collaborative Centre for Inflammation Research (MCCIR; Hussell)
   Respiratory Medicine (RespMed; Smith)
   Centre for Musculoskeletal Research (CfMR; Barton).
   Centre for Dermatology Research (CfDR; Griffiths)
   Infection (Infection; Denning)
 Technology:
   Biomarker Technologies (BiomTech: Whetton)
   Regenerative Medicine (RegenMed: Hoyland)
 Medical Humanities: (MedHum: Snow)

                                                                                               Page 5
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)




 1.5 Contextualising UoA1’s research environment
 1.5.1: Within UoM. UoM’s research environment is predicated on multidisciplinary research (4.1,
 REF5a.2ii/iii). Hence, whilst core membership of our Research Groups is based on clinical focus,
 researchers can call upon individuals and teams with generic skills (platform technologists, health
 economists, data analysts etc.) and specialised facilities (3.5. 3.6. 4.1) from other Groups and
 Institutes, enhancing trans-disciplinarity without diluting specialist expertise.
 Figure 2 illustrates how UoA1’s Research Groups recruit members from the Divisions of FBMH’s
 three Schools. As an indicator of how cross-fertilisation of ideas and skills contributes to our
 research, 179 of the 538 REF2 outputs are with members of other UoAs (particularly UoA2:
 Epidemiologists, Health informaticians, Health economists, and UoA5 Biological Scientists, but
 also others across UoAs as detailed in 4.1.3)

 1.5.2: NHS Environment: Research and infrastructure of our BRC, ARC-GM, MCRF, PSTRC and
 LCRN are integrated within NHS structures at a UoM/NHS interface mission-critical for
 experimental medicine, to complete the “One Manchester” environment.
 MAHSC is key to ensuring smooth operation of research around and across this interface. UoA1
 researchers hold major strategic roles in MAHSC (Figure 3) ensuring alignment of UoA1’s strategy
 with that of GMHSCP.




                                                                                             Page 6
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 Redesignated in 2020, MAHSC, (one of eight NIHR/NHSE/NHS Improvement AHSCs nationally),
 strategically aligns NHS organisations and UoM, to facilitate translation, creating opportunities for
 UoM’s academics and NHS clinicians to conduct cross-cutting translational research within GM.
 The comments of the redesignation panel emphasise how well MAHSC has delivered this agenda.
 They stated the: “volume, breadth, and quality of [our] research, education, and strategic plan was
 strong, with alignment to the NHS Long Term Plan, Life Sciences Industrial Strategy, and goals of
 the Accelerated Access Collaborative” and applauded our track record of “translating scientific
 advances into patient benefit, system-wide leadership for specific innovative technologies,
 capacity and plans for contributing to economic growth through partnerships with commercial
 organisations, and clear route for commercialisation of innovative technologies”.




 1.5.3 Our wider environment is global, (Figure 1) incorporating other Universities, our community
 and industry. Discussed in Section 4.

 1.6 Activities and Impact of each Research Group
 We describe the activities and some key discoveries of our Groups and their themes, illustrating
 how our research environment has encouraged academic endeavour. We also headline the future
 research strategies of each Group, and present a sample of REF2/3 outputs to indicate the scope,

                                                                                               Page 7

 grants; 4: Collaborative research).

 SPECIFIC DISEASE TYPE/SYSTEM CLUSTER

 1.6.1 CANCER (Cancer 70.65 FTE)
 Background
 Cancer is a UoM Research Beacon.
 Our environment incorporates UoA1’s discovery-focused £40m CRUK Manchester Institute
 (CRUK-MI: Marais), and comprehensive £35m CRUK Major Cancer Centre (Bristow, Marais),
 which with MAHSC’s NHS Trusts form the over-arching Manchester Cancer Research Centre
 (MCRC: Bristow). UoA1’s cancer research is largely based in our lead cancer Trust - The Christie,
 Europe’s largest single-site cancer centre, seeing >44,000 patients/year. Of ~10,000 new patients
 in 2019, >2,000 entered clinical trials. The Christie also houses the UK’s first NHS high energy
 proton beam therapy centre (NHS/NIHR: £125m). Research is undertaken by the PRECISE
 research group (Kirkby: £16m EPSRC/EU/BRC).
 During REF2021 MCRC has delivered growth through translation of basic/discovery research into
 hospital and community healthcare, which in GM, is addressing the NHS long-term goals of earlier
 cancer detection; precision risk assessment; and increased survival.
 This strategy has enhanced our environment through £120m funding of external Centre Awards
 during REF2021 (3.2) which focus on our research.
 Major research themes
 Cancer research in Manchester covers nine major themes.
 CRUK-MI Discovery (Marais, Dive) Spanning the spectrum of basic cancer research, our
 discoveries prime novel translational and clinical research, CRUK-MI researchers have made
 important discoveries across molecular oncology (Viros, Nature.2014:REF2ID:38898076),
 translational oncogenetics, cell division, systems oncology (Bristow, Cell.2018:
 REF2ID:84676050), cell signalling, cancer immunology (Zelenay, Cell.2015:REF2ID:39037165),
 and drug discovery (Springer, Cancer.Cell.2014:REF2ID:38895404).
 Experimental Cancer Medicine (Krebs, Makin). ECM aligns genetics (Astley,
 JAMA.Oncol.2018:REF2ID:64158134), molecular profiling, biobanking, imaging (Valle,
 ESMO.Open.2020:REF2ID:175167302; Jackson, J.Nuc.Med.2015:REF2ID:116756477), and
 biomarker discovery (Krebs, Nature.Med.2019:REF2ID:85366722) allowing patient stratification
 to deliver effective phase I/II trials (~300 adults and children/year) employing digital
 technology/science to optimise patient engagement and clinical decision making
 Genomics (Evans, reported in UoA2)
 Prevention & early detection (PED) (Crosbie, Howell) Leading the BRC £2.7m PED theme and
 integrated within CRUK’s International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection (ACED), PED has
 explored and translated novel ways of detecting cancer (P.Crosbie, REF3 Impact Case), and
 developed     clinically-relevant strategies   for   prevention   (A.Howell,   Lancet.2019:
 REF2ID:158351714) and intervention (E.Crosbie, Int.J.Cancer.2019:REF2ID:82680279).


                                                                                              Page 8
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 Radiotherapy-related research (Choudhury) Has made advances in all aspects of radiotherapy
 research from pre-clinical radiobiology to clinical therapy (Faivre-Finn, REF3 Impact Case).
 Particular discoveries in REF2021 are in the fields of technical radiotherapy (Taylor,
 Com.Phys.Com.2020:REF2ID:158179007), radiogenomics (Choudhury, Clin.Canc.Res.2017:
 REF2ID:63004429), radiotherapy-immunotherapy combinations (Illidge, J.Clin.Oncol.2014:
 REF2ID:38883666), theranostics and predictors of treatment toxicity and response.
 Tumour microenvironment (Bristow, Malliri) Our research within the Wellcome Centre for Cell-
 Matrix Research (UoA5) and CRUK-MI has established novel cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions
 driving cancer behaviour (Malliri, Cell.Reps.2014:REF2ID:38897887) that have been harnessed
 clinically (Bristow, Lancet.Oncology.2014:REF2ID:84676224; Illidge, EMBO.Mol.Med.2017,
 REF2ID:63598214)
 Targeted and Immuno-oncology (Illidge), Incorporating Innovate UK iMATCH (Innovate
 Manchester Advanced Therapy Centre Hub), one of only three cell-therapy consortia focused on
 activity scale-up, safety and delivery in clinical ATMP trials (Owens, J.Immunotherapy.2018:
 REF2ID:170772378), has investigated cancer evasion of immune surveillance, and harnessed
 cellular immunity (Honeychurch, Clin.Canc.Res.2017:REF2ID:63597969), and antibody-based
 treatment therapeutically. (Illidge, REF3 Impact Case; Faivre-Finn, J.Nat.Canc.Inst.2014:
 REF2ID:38779070).
 Centre for Biomarker Sciences (Dive, reported in BiomTech 1.6.10).
 Clinical Oncology (Radford); Pulling information from preclinical groups (Saha,
 Lancet.Haematol.2019:REF2ID:102909622), industry and experimental cancer medicine (Lee,
 Ann.Oncol.2019:REF2ID:131872567) and working with Christie clinicians and international
 collaborators has benefited patients through changed treatment pathways in chemo- and
 chemoradiotherapy combinations. (Radford, REF3 Impact Case; Illidge, NEJM.2015:
 REF2ID:38883662; Blackhall, JAMA.Oncol.2018:REF2ID:84326687).
 Future Research
 We will deepen our science in current research areas, building on large CRUK infrastructure
 awards. Some areas, now evolving out of prescient developments in cancer science, deserve
 special mention:
 Strategic Team Science and New Research Building: The Paterson Rebuild (£150m,
 30,0000m2, Q4-2022 move-in) funded by MCRC partners (UKRPIF £25m, Wolfson Foundation
 £5m) will radically enhance our environment by co-locating teams of UoM researchers with NHS
 clinicians, manifesting as “collaborate zones” designed, through interaction, to drive our science
 into clinical trials and NHS uptake with further pace and scale.
 Early Cancer: We will direct activity towards detection and early intervention in pancreatic, lung
 and hereditary cancers (combines BRC PED theme and CRUK ACED awards) giving new
 direction to cancer diagnosis particularly “difficult-to-manage” cancers (pancreas, lung, ovary)
 Proton Beam and Experimental Radiotherapy: Our £16.5m CRUK Radiation Centre of
 Excellence grant allows development of the UK’s only National Proton Research Facility with in-
 vitro and in-vivo experimental beams and development of FLASH microsecond radiotherapy,
 reducing toxicity. We will also focus on hypoxia- and molecular-targeted therapies and radio-
 immunotherapy placing the UK at the forefront of proton research.
 Cancer Immunology will develop Cancer Immunotherapy, co-creating multi-modality approaches
 to cancer early interception by exploring immune status in early cancers, designing new solid
 tumour chimaeric antigen receptor, T-cell receptor, and tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte therapies,


                                                                                            Page 9
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 matching novel ATIMPs to relevant cancers, as well as trialling novel antibody-based therapies,
 leveraging funding from commercial partners (e.g. Gritstone Oncology 4.5).
 Digital Cancer Centre will implement new AI-driven trials for elderly patients with comorbidities
 combining resource from Christie’s electronic Patient Reported Outcome Measures and Data
 Insight programme, new HEE Data Sciences training grant, teams led by UoM’s two Health-AI
 Professors (Kaski [UoA11: partnership with Aalto University, Finland]; Yau [UoA11: co-Director of
 the Health Data Research UK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science]), IDSAI,
 and UoM’s Digital Futures platform (4.1) to provide more appropriate cancer care for the elderly.
 Molecular Proteomics and Biomarkers of Resistance We will develop in-situ proteomics and
 AI to analyse cancer tissue sections defining novel biopsy-based biomarker signatures in
 Christie’s new Academic Pathology Unit, co-located with the Cancer Biomarkers Centre. This will
 build on our discovery research, generating novel precision medicine tests employing (ultimately
 autonomously) machine-learning to guide therapies, predict responses and outcomes, whilst
 addressing the critical world-wide shortage of histopathologists.
 Intelligent Onco-Materials: Collaborating with Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, National
 Graphene Institute (Graphene Institute 3.5.3) and Royce Advanced Institute, we will develop new
 nano-oncology programmes exploring nanoparticles to: recognise clinically pertinent protein
 changes post-radiotherapy; permit early-detection cancer signals; design and develop biosensors
 and bio-wearables (for instance, to flag early neutropenic sepsis and cytokine storms); and create
 artificial cancer-associated chromosomal loci expressed in primary cells for novel models of copy
 number gain.

 1.6.2 CARDIOVASCULAR SCIENCES (CVS 28.91 FTE)
 Background
 Working across cardiovascular physiology and disease, including disease causes (diabetes,
 hypertension) and effects (acute cardiac syndromes [ACS], stroke), during REF2021 our research
 impacted the whole discovery-to-translation landscape.
 Our clinical environment has been enhanced through formation of an integrated Manchester Heart
 Centre, allowing us access to a tertiary care population of ~6m.
 Major research themes
 Integrative cardiac physiology (ICP): (Eisner [BHF Chair]) ICP has made significant
 mechanistic discoveries, incorporating causes, effects and potential therapeutic targets in and of:
 myocardial hypertrophy (Kitmitto, Nature.Comms.2019, REF2ID:143030568), heart failure
 (Trafford, Sci.Rep.2019:REF2ID:108002857); ion channels and their regulation (Nelson,
 Sci.Reps.2016:REF2ID:51338108),         cardiac    rhythms     and      dysrhythmias      (Morris,
 Nature.Comms.2014:REF2ID:38653466); and cardiac dysfunction (Ray, Nature.Comms.2017:
 REF2ID:116757117), using laboratory science, in-vitro/in-vivo model systems, and patient
 studies.
 Genetics of cardiovascular disease: (Keavney [BHF Chair]) CVS genetics, collaborating with
 UoA1’s Genetics Research Group (1.6.4), using 100,000 genomes data, and gene
 deletion/silencing technologies (Cartwright, J.Mol.Cardiol.2014:REF2ID:159757480; D’souza,
 Sci.Reps.2020:REF2ID:182172032) has identified new genes/gene-variants underlying
 cardiovascular conditions, including: atheroma (Tomaszewski, Art.Thromb.Vasc.Biol.2019:
 REF2ID:157870719); congenital heart disease (Black, Circ.Res.2019:REF2ID:157870694), and
 dysrhythmias (Venetucci, J.Hum.Gen.2020:REF2ID:172892859).

 Micro- and macro-vascular disease: (Heagerty). Has defined vascular homeostatic
 mechanisms (Greenstein, Science.Signal.2016:REF2ID:51334938), structural and functional
 vascular changes in hypertension and diabetes (Nelson, Science.Signal.2014:
 REF2ID:38921840), and the role of perivascular fat in causation and reversal of vascular
 dysfunction (Heagerty, Sci.Reps.2017:REF2ID:64529271).
 Clinical innovations: (Tomaszewski) Has pioneered practical diagnostics (Miller,
 J.Am.Col.Cardiol.2014:REF2ID:38899460), treatments and pathways for common
 cardiac/vascular disorders including: suspected ACS (Body, REF3 Impact Case, hypertension
 (Tomaszewski, Eur.Heart.J.2019:REF2ID:158685661), blood pressure management before
 surgery (Heagerty, Anaesthesia.2016:REF2ID:51478759), and stroke (Parry-Jones,
 Ann.Neurol.2019:REF2ID:135391772).
 Future Research
 We will continue building on our successes through a programme of future-proofing, diversifying
 and expanding our researcher base:
 Future proofing: £1m BHF Accelerator Award will build stronger cross-disciplinary research
 collaborations, involving physical scientists and humanities scholars, promoting research
 innovation and holistic approaches to understanding causes and effects of cardiovascular disease.
 Global Challenges Funding (~£800k;MRC/DIFD) will be used to expand the pool of clinicians
 dealing with cardiovascular diseases in developing countries, reducing global inequality.
 Our strong cadre of ECRs and new lecturers, (Miller, Pinali, D’Souza, Morris) with funded
 fellowships complementing the research of our two BHF Chairs (Keavney, Eisner) and supported
 by PhD students on our BHF 4-year PhD programme will extend and futureproof our science in
 pathophysiology and genetics.
 Exploiting HInM’s adoption pipeline. HInM’s translational route has taken Body’s algorithms
 across GM. It is supporting this and other clinical packages from local adoption to national
 implementation, for instance: Parry-Jones’ ABC-intracranial haemorrhage care bundle (reduces
 30-day deaths from 35.5% to 24.2%) and urinary mass spectrometry for antihypertensive
 metabolites (Tomaszewski) increasing compliance up to 50%. Emerging clinical research
 packages will be directed down this route giving accelerated uptake for patient benefit.
 Cardiac Imaging: Launched 11/2020, BCMRR 3T-MRI (£3.1m) will accelerate delivery of
 experimental medicine and translational cardiovascular and stroke research using imaging
 biomarkers. Its introduction as part of an expanded programme of Sports Cardiology Research
 will bring insights into why ethnicity influences cardiac deaths in athletes.


 1.6.3 DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE (DBM 18.5 FTE)
 Background
 DBM undertakes research across fetal development, organogenesis, infancy and childhood. It has
 improved early-life outcomes and increased understanding of stem cells and their uses and the
 genetic programming of organogenesis. Clinical outreach is through MFT’s specialist
 regional/super-regional clinics.




                                                                                          Page 11
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 Major research themes
 Tommy’s Centre for Maternal and Fetal Health (Heazell): Has improved understanding of
 human placental blood flow and its regulation (Aplin, Theranostics.2017:REF2ID:59973955)
 demonstrating how and when it influences: fetal development (Brownbill, J.Physiol.2015:
 REF2ID:38655081); and survival. Research has also changed lives: of families with previous
 stillbirths (Heazell, REF3 Impact Case); women with pregnancy complications (Myers,
 Hypertension.2020:REF2ID:177316240); following assisted reproductive technology (ART); and
 of fetuses and infants of epileptic mothers (Bromley, Neurology.2014:REF2ID:38767339).
 Paediatric Growth and Development (Clayton) working with national/international collaborators
 to established patient cohorts at scale, has improved long-term health for children with maternally-
 induced congenital (Banka, Am.J.Hum.Gen.2016:REF2ID:51535113) and acquired (Bromley,
 JAMA.Pediatrics.2014:REF2ID:38654821) disorders that can significantly impair long-term
 health (diabetes, cognition, hypertension, obesity [Clayton, JAMA.2018:REF2ID:84110213],
 cardiovascular disease, cancer).
 Developmental Haematopoiesis (Lacaud) Has discovered molecular (Lacaud, Blood.2014:
 REF2ID:51157594; Lacaud, Develop.Cell.2016:REF2ID:51157536) and cellular mechanisms
 controlling haematopoiesis and stem cell homeostasis (Lacaud, Nature.Cell.Biol.2016:
 REF2ID:51157535) generating data with the potential to improve marrow transplantation and
 haematopoietic stem cell generation from pluripotent stem cells (Batta, Cell.Reps.2014:
 REF2ID:38891096).
 Human Organogenesis (HO): (Hanley) HO has deciphered genomic mechanisms underlying
 organ and tissue development (Jennings, eLife.2016:REF2ID:50473112), instructing
 regenerative medicine; and explaining normal and deranged molecular mechanisms leading to
 developmental disorders (Birket, Stem.Cell.Reports.2019:REF2ID:135691559) and cancer
 (Hanley, Genome.Res.2019:REF2ID:116757229).
 Future Research
 In-utero fetal development: Tommy’s-funded £2m infrastructure, Heazell’s NIHR Clinician
 Scientist Award, and £2m MRC programme grant underpin research into the major global issues
 of poor intrauterine growth, stillbirth, and postpartum maternal and child health. It will focus on:
 placental immunity (with MCCIR); defining biomarkers and therapeutic targets to manage
 modifiable risk; and perturbed intrauterine growth; improving clinical care of women at risk of
 stillbirth; and enhancing understanding of the placenta’s role in early embryo development.
 Maternal effects on post-partem development and disease: The pan-European DohART-NET
 (UoM £450k) will continue to generate scalable research in rare paediatric disorders, and
 strengthen studies of parental factors in development of children’s lifelong morbidities, promoting
 pre-natal approaches to disease prevention and novel routes into personalised interventions.
 Developmental haemopoiesis: Future research supported through CRUK-MI and collaborations
 with GM’s Manchester Genetics Medicine Centre (1.6.4), will apply epigenomics to: human stem
 cell differentiation; investigating cellular heterogeneity’s influence on differentiation; and decode
 cell fate decisions, generating clinical value through applying the consequent findings to stimulate
 in-vivo blood cell production (e.g. in aplastic anaemia), and in-vitro, for bone marrow replacement
 and transfusable blood production.
 Organogenesis: Our future research will continue our work on the genetic basis of organ
 formation and its regulation. This will inform the research of DBM, and develop novel therapeutic
 approaches based on ex-vivo stem cell manipulation for use in regenerative medicine.

 1.6.4. GENETIC AND GENOMIC MEDICINE (Genetics 15.8 FTE)
 Background
 Working within GM’s Genetic Medicine Centre (GMGMC) UoA1’s researchers have discovered
 new genetic diseases and disease mechanisms, informing clinical management.
 GMGMC is a cross-disciplinary NHS/UoM, diagnostic, treatment and research facility led by
 UoA1’s Newman. It intermeshes with GM’s Genomics Laboratory Hub in the £28m/year NHS
 Genomic Medicine Centre serving a tertiary care population of ~3.5m. They are part of a “Genetics
 Campus” at MFT Oxford Road incorporating purpose-designed buildings (Citylabs) for industry
 and UoM partners. Proximity to GMGMC and quality infrastructure attract companies such as
 Yourgene, APIS. (Citylabs1.0) and Qiagen (Citylabs2.0) to site UK/European bases in
 Manchester.
 Genetics’ academics support other UoM academics’ gene-based research through quality,
 specialised infrastructure, facilitating phenotyping, genotyping and reverse phenotyping and
 identifying novel disease genes/genetic diseases. For instance we have reverse phenotyped
 ~1,000 children recruited to the “Deciphering Developmental Disorders” study and >1,000
 individuals with developmental disorders to the “100,000 Genomes” study.
 Major Research Themes
 Genetic technology: Has developed: new techniques that advance disease gene discovery
 (Tassabehji, Nature.Gen.2019:REF2ID:160856730); and new approaches to improve clinical
 diagnostics (Black, Ophthalmology.2016:REF2 ID: 50458991).
 Ophthalmic Genetics (Bishop) through improved understanding of genetic mechanisms
 (Manson,     PNAS.2015:REF2ID:56432209)     has   discovered    biomarkers    (Bishop,
 Nature.Comms.2020:REF2ID:158531561) of genetically linked blindness. Pioneering use of
 gene-therapy has led to successful treatments of hereditary blindness (Bishop,
 Current.Biology.2015:REF2ID:38652882; Black, NEJM.2016:REF2ID:56432208).
 Immunogenetics (Briggs) has changed understanding of interferonopathies, rare (Briggs,
 Science.Immunol.2019:REF2ID:158168536) neurodevelopmental and vascular disorders,
 causally overlapping with autoimmune diseases (Crow, J.Exp.Med.2017:REF2ID:83332084),
 translating findings into clinical outreach (Crow, Nature.Gen.2014:REF2ID:38659252) through
 GM’s immunogenetic testing centres (one of two in England).
 Developmental Genetics (Banka) has discovered and characterised novel genetic mechanisms
 (Banka: Am.J.Hum.Gen.2017:REF2ID:85195012; Am.J.Hum.Gen.2017:REF2ID:85195013;
 Am.J.Hum.Gen.2017:REF2ID:64800873) behind developmental abnormalities to understand
 syndromic backgrounds (Roberts, Kid.Int.2019:REF2ID:84828682; Crow, Nature.Gen.2016:
 REF2ID:50410335) and stratify patients.
 Cancer Genetics (Evans reported in UoA2).
 Kay N Hinckley Centre for Biomedical Egyptology (KNHCBE)’s aDNA group (Drosou), has
 definitively identified previously highly disputed familial lineages in 3,800 year old Pharaonic
 Egyptians (Drosou, J.Arch.Sci.2018:REF2ID:133994639]).
 Future Research
 We will develop our research by exploiting the platforms and approaches we have built in
 GMGMC.
 Gene therapy. The progress in gene therapy for blindness (Bishop MRC £1.45m) in mice and
 pilots of 24 patients with xeroderma pigmentosa and choroideremia, has opened the way for

                                                                                          Page 13
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 translational gene therapy research under our gene therapy licence, further improving outcomes
 in patients with hereditary blindness and extending into disorders of other systems.
 Diagnostics: Success developing a low-cost point-of-care test with Genedrive (UoM-spinout
 2007), preventing neonatal gentamycin-induced hearing loss (Newman NIHR-i4i £900k, BRC
 Hearing Theme £3.6m) represents a paradigm for developing near-patient diagnostics for
 genetically-mediated disorders in any body system. Global translation through existing funding
 (ESRC £160k) to take genomic medicine into Africa, will leverage further opportunities for
 deployment of gene-based technologies into low-income countries.
 Gene discovery: GMGMC brings understanding to hereditary disorders through
 genophenotyping and reverse phenotyping. The NHS Genomics Medicine Centre will accelerate
 translation, advancing pre- and postnatal diagnosis, and patient management
 Platform Technologies: Through our genomics platforms and experience of
 experimental/translational genetic medicine we will input into other groups’ genetic investigations
 (e.g. Cancer, CVS, CfMR) enhanced by continually upgraded research infrastructure (most
 recently: polygenic risk scoring, multi-omics [with Whetton BiomTech], UoM’s big data analytics)
 for advancing personalised medicine.
 Ancient DNA: £1.1m funding and access to hard/soft tissue biorepositories (KNH: 360 individuals
 spanning 5000yr) will be harnessed to study genetic disease development, and micro-evolutional
 responses to climate change and infections, informing modern global questions.

 INFLAMMATION, INFECTION AND IMMUNITY CLUSTER:
 UoA1 has major research activity around inflammation and its management, reflected here in five
 Groups with shared goals, cross-cutting technologies and collaborative research/outputs.
 Their common research, brings international leadership in diagnosing and managing Immune-
 Mediated Inflammatory Diseases (IMIDs) and catalyses development of highly characterised
 patient cohorts (e.g. through five Manchester-led/co-led MRC Stratified Medicine Initiatives
 [~£20m during REF2021, 3.2.3]), and Manchester-led biologics registries.

 Clock biology is a common research theme across these Groups and one increasingly embraced
 by Cancer (Bulfone-Paus, OncoImmunology.2015:REF2ID:38655527) and CVS (Ray,
 Nature.Comms.2017:REF2ID:116757117). All our Inflammation Research Groups have
 researchers working within UoM’s Centre for Biological Timing (CBT), the largest clock biology
 community in Europe (27 PIs, 154 researchers, £56m active grant funding).
 UoA1 researchers bring clinical guidance and direction to CBT’s research, whilst within this
 collaborative, skills spanning clock biology, model organisms, and fundamental cellular events are
 employed by UoA1’s researchers to make discoveries of clinical importance (examples in each
 Group) that impact when and how patients are assessed and treatment given for optimum effect
 (e.g. Lung inflammation [Gibbs, Nature.Med.2014:REF2ID:38792277]; success of lung
 transplantation, [Durrington, Thorax 2018:REF2ID:77977672], Intervertebral disc degeneration,
 [Hoyland, Ann.Rheum.Dis.2017:REF2ID:50943914]).

 1.6.5 MANCHESTER COLLABORATIVE CENTRE FOR INFLAMMATION RESEARCH
 (MCCIR: 10.8 FTE)
 Background
 UoA1 researchers contribute to MCCIR through overall leadership (Director Hussell), and leading
 3 of 14 themes: Lung immunity (Hussell); Homeostasis and Pathogenesis (Bulfone-Paus); Skin
 inflammation (Saunders), and bringing clinical focus across the Centre.
 Examples of Research Achievements
 During REF2021, UoA1’s research in MCCIR has:
   Characterised novel immune mechanisms (Arkwright, Nature.2014:REF2ID:38652407;
    Lord, J.Clin.Invest.2019:REF2ID:134867970) across a spectrum of human diseases (eg.
    asthma [Hussell, J.Al.Clin.Immun.2017:REF2ID:61456947], Crohn’s disease [Lord,
    Gastroenterology.2019:REF2ID:134867985],       colonic    cancer    [Bulfone-Paus,
    OncoImmunology.2015:REF2ID:38655527]);
   Changed understanding of allergy (Mills, J.Al.Clin.Imm.2015:REF2ID:38921447; Allen,
    J.Al.Clin.Imm.2015:REF2ID:38651799 and J.Al.Clin.Imm.2014:REF2ID:38651803), and its
    diagnosis and management (Mills, J.Al.Clin.Imm.2018:REF2ID:64483222);
   Improved clinically-critical understanding of circadian cycles in lung disease (bronchial
    inflammation [Gibbs, Nature.Med.2014:REF2ID:38792277; and J.Clin.Invest.2018:
    REF2ID:83321223], lung fibrosis [Kitchen, PNAS.2020:REF2ID:158703217], pneumonia
    [Kitchen, PNAS.2020:REF2ID:158729230] and lung transplantation [Durrington,
    Thorax.2018:REF2ID:77977672])
   Defined responses         to    SARS-Cov-2      (1.10;   [Hussell,    Science.Immunol.2020:
    REF2ID:176556622]).
 Future Research
 Immune phenotyping and responses to SARS-CoV: With UK-CIC (UKRI/NIHR £6.5m), we will
 continue to identify risk immunophenotypes in COVID-19 patients, and develop susceptibility
 testing strategies for future SARS-CoV variant epidemics.
 Understanding disease mechanisms in inflammatory lung disease: Hussell’s £1.7m WI with
 BRC Respiratory Theme funding, will stimulate discovery of novel immune mechanisms regulating
 bronchial and alveolar pathology in asthma and COPD, informing changes in disease
 management.
 Food allergy and childhood allergen desensitisation are an ongoing NIHR/MRC (£1.6m) and
 FSA (£1.8m) funded research programme. Gibb’s £600k MRC-funded studies of systemic
 immune-modulation by human microbiomes will bring a new and clinically important perspective
 to mechanisms underlying food allergy.
 Collaborative research: We will bring our expertise to collaborations with other groups:
 “Tommy’s”: placental immunology; “RespMed, CfMR, and CfDR, exploring basement membrane
 integrity in organ-specific immunity; Cancer: examining immune status in early cancer, developing
 novel anti-cancer ATIMP strategies; Diversify approaches to antimicrobial resistance with Infection
 (1.6.9) harnessing immune mechanisms for anti-bacterial therapies.

 1.6.6. RESPIRATORY MEDICINE (RespMed 10.2 FTE)
 Background
 Respiratory Medicine is a BRC theme (£2.8m).
 Our environment is enriched by undertaking clinical research within the NW Lung Centre (one of
 England’s largest: 40 consultants); and, broad national and international collaborations.
 RespMed has led discovery of disease mechanisms, diagnostics, and, through phase I-III trials,
 designed novel treatments that have improved lives of patients with the respiratory diseases:
 childhood asthma (Murray), chronic cough (Smith), chronic pulmonary obstructive disease
 (COPD) (Singh, Woodcock), and cystic fibrosis (Horsley)
 Major Research Themes
 Technological advances/diagnostics aiding patient management: Recognising that
 technological advance enhances diagnosis and study conduct, RespMed has made innovations
 in how respiratory disease is diagnosed (Papadopoulos, Nature.Comms.2018:
 REF2ID:84378043), measured (Smith REF3 Impact Case), and studied (Whitfield,
 Plos.One.2018:REF2ID:120890152; Horsley, Eur.Resp.Journal.2016:REF2ID:50614334).
 Childhood asthma (Murray): Has advanced understanding of disease mechanisms, including
 using novel analytical approaches to cohort data (Murray, PLOS.Medicine.2018:
 REF2ID:84929282), making diagnoses (Durrington, Lancet.Child.Adolesc.Health.2017:
 REF2ID:63507545), defining prognosis (Murray, Clin.Exp.Allergy.2019:REF2ID:158242127)
 and practical interventions (Murray, Am.J.Resp.Crit.Care.Med.2017:REF2ID:64483095)
 Chronic cough (Smith, Woodcock) Has discovered novel cough mechanisms (Woodcock,
 Am.J.Resp.Crit.Care.2015:REF2ID:51284284) and changed the landscape in conducting
 meaningful clinical trials through the development of an objective “cough test” (Smith, REF3
 Impact Case), improving the effectiveness of trials of anti-tussives (Smith, Lancet.2015:
 REF2ID:38939363).
 COPD (Singh): using large Manchester-based and collaborative patient cohorts, has
 demonstrated the efficacy of new approaches to the use of novel and established drugs, alone
 and in combination (Singh, Woodcock, REF Impact Case) to optimise management of COPD in
 hospital and the community (Woodcock, NEJM.2016:REF2ID:50457821), with a particular focus
 on preventing exacerbations (Singh, NEJM.2019:EF2ID:158455208) requiring hospital
 admission.
 Cystic fibrosis: has driven personalised medicine through genetically-guided therapies (Horsley,
 Chest.2014:REF2ID:38794083 and NEJM.2018:REF2ID:82928469) and increased awareness of
 the scope of pulmonary comorbidities (Denning, PLOS.One.2014:REF2ID:38662758).
 Future Research
 Airways disease: The BRC Respiratory Theme will:
  Allow RespMed to grow research in understanding triggers and prevention of acute
   exacerbations of COPD, through biomarker-led trials within the Manchester-led international
   DisEntangling Chronic Obstructive pulmonary Disease Exacerbations NETwork (DECODE-
   NET) giving access to at-scale cohorts.
  Underpin future cystic fibrosis research exploring novel gene-based and gene expression
   approaches to management, in collaboration with Bigger (RegenMed).
 Chronic Cough: Smith’s WI Award (£1.6m) enables expansion of mechanistic understanding of
 cough, feeding clinical trials through the European Respiratory Society’s Clinical Research

                                                                                         Page 16
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 Collaborative (NEuroCOUGH). Smith’s development of an objective cough measuring instrument
 (Smith, REF3 Impact Case) offers unparalleled opportunities for industry-driven anti-tussive
 collaborative trials informing much needed point-of-care anti-tussive evaluation and validation.

 1.6.7. CENTRE FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL RESEARCH (CfMR: 14.25 FTE)
 Background
 CfMR, a European League Against Rheumatism Centre of Excellence, incorporates two Versus
 Arthritis Centres of Excellence, Genetics & Genomics (VACEGG, reported here) and
 Epidemiology (reported in UoA2). It hosts the £4.5m BRC Musculoskeletal Theme, and largest
 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) biologics registry internationally (BSRBR-RA).
 Research has driven discovery of the genetic/gene-expression basis of disease and improved
 lives of patients with musculoskeletal IMIDs (RA, lupus, psoriatic arthritis [PsA]) by bringing the
 power of: digital epidemiology; modern genomics; and experimental medicine to bear on well-
 characterised patient cohorts from registries.
 Major Research Themes
 Advances in gene technologies relevant to IMIDs (Raychaudhuri): CfMR academics have
 developed novel ways of generating (Orozco, Sci.Reports.2020:REF2ID:177697976) and
 interrogating DNA and RNA datasets that impact directly both on understanding of autoimmune
 diseases (Raychaudhuri, Nature.Gen.2016:REF2ID:62520052) and how personalised
 treatments are defined (Barton, Ann.Rheum.Dis.2018:REF2ID:132446682).
 Genetic predisposition to IMIDs (Eyre): VACEGG academics have uncovered common genetic
 traits linking autoimmune disorders (Raychaudhuri, Nature.Gen.2015:REF2ID:38923696; Eyre,
 Nature.Comms.2015:REF2ID:38776697).
 Rheumatoid Arthritis (Barton): Patient stratification based on clinical (Barton,
 Arth.Res.Ther.2018:REF2ID:84778509) and genetic measures applied to Manchester cohorts
 and international Manchester-led registries, brought new understanding of: the role of key genes
 in the genesis of RA (Eyre, Nature.Gen.2018:REF2ID:78449349 and Nature.Comms.2020:
 REF2ID:177697963), disease behaviour and treatment response (Barton, Nature.2014:
 REF2ID:38652684; Viatte, JAMA.2015:REF2ID:38652680), and guided patient stratification
 (Buch, Arth.Rheum.2018:REF2ID:78240777)
 Lupus (Bruce): The lupus group has used registry data and trials of carefully characterised patient
 groups to enhance outcomes and reduce disease activity, based on improved understanding of
 underlying disease mechanisms (Briggs, Arth.Rheum.2016:REF2ID:51322901) and disease
 presentation (Bruce, Ann.Rheum.Dis.2014:REF2ID:38655382); and through carefully targeted
 trials of novel therapies, particularly biologics (Bruce, NEJM.2020:REF2ID:164703773).
 PsA (Bowes): In collaboration with CfDR have used the PSORT cohort to show PsA has a
 different genetic basis to psoriasis (Bowes, Ann.Rheum.Dis.2015:REF2ID:63640309), affecting
 psoriasis long-term outcomes (Bluett, Nature.Comms.2015:REF2ID:38652682) and
 management.
 Future Research
 We will build international leadership in five areas through linked programmes.
 Genetics/Genomics: In collaboration with GMGMC we will align Versus Arthritis (£2m) Genetics
 and Genomics Centre activity with Orozco’s Wellcome SF programme developing functional



                                                                                            Page 17
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 genomics/genome editing to identify causal gene signatures in musculoskeletal IMIDs,
 progressing their individual and shared molecular taxonomy.
 Biorepository-based Research: BRC-funded Lupus Extended Autoimmune Phenotype Cohort,
 BSRBR-RA and NIHR IMID BioResource enable design and execution of experimental medicine,
 proof-of-concept studies, and trials at scale in selected patient subsets, focusing on shared
 molecular processes across different IMIDs.
 Evidenced therapeutics: Our goal is “targeting the right drugs, to the right patients, at the right
 time” based on outcomes and data sets from our MRC Stratified Medicine Initiatives. Follow-on
 phase 2/3 studies will employ adaptive and Bayesian approaches to clinical trial design, thereby
 improving trial efficiency, enhancing our ability to treat relevant subsets effectively.
 Optimising drug adherence: BRC MSK theme funding allows further programme development
 to optimise therapy adherence, using behavioural psychology and biofeedback interventions
 coupled with drug level testing, improving disease control across IMIDs.
 Digital Epidemiology: underpins inflammatory/non-inflammatory joint disease research. With
 Centre for Epidemiology colleagues (UoA2) we will further develop methodological rigour for digital
 tools, wearables and routinely collected data in collaboration with UoM’s big data and health
 informatics groups, using these leading-edge technologies to improve understanding of patient-
 reported outcomes and multimorbidity, facilitating person-centred care; and validated safety of
 novel IMID therapies.

 1.6.8 CENTRE FOR DERMATOLOGICAL RESEARCH (CfDR: 11.55 FTE)
 Background
 CfDR’s research has improved understanding and outcomes in skin disease management by
 applying basic research technologies to understand underlying pathogenesis and true burden.
 Close, long-standing collaborations with industry have enabled targeted clinical trials in: psoriasis;
 photodermatoses; and skin ageing (within Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research into
 Ageing [MICRA; 4.1]).
 CfDR hosts the BRC Dermatology theme (£2.8m) and the world’s largest pharmacovigilance
 register for psoriasis (BADBIR; 20,000 registrations).
 Clinical research takes place in dedicated Dermatopharmacology and Photobiology Units in
 Salford Royal’s GM Dermatology Centre (largest in England with 40 consultants).
 Major Research Themes
 Ultraviolet radiation biology and medicine (Rhodes): has uncovered: clinically important
 cellular (O’Neill, Sci.Reports.2018:REF2ID:157881800) and immunological changes (Farrar,
 Clin.Translat.Imm.2020:REF2ID:158447985) in UV damaged skin; the role of skin type in
 differential tissue and gene damage (Rhodes, J.Inv.Derm.2018:REF2ID:82375603), and the
 importance of active management of vitamin D prophylaxis in UK latitudes (Farrar,
 Nutrients.2018:REF2ID:84663907).
 Psoriasis (Griffiths, Warren): Has described the global impact of psoriasis (Griffiths, BMJ.2020:
 REF2ID:178908742), and heightened awareness of the comorbidities of psoriasis itself (Young,
 J.Invest.Derm.2015:REF2ID:38937348; Kleyn, Br.J.Dermatol.2018:REF2 ID:85216881) and
 psoriasis treatments (Yiu, J.Invest.Derm.2018:REF2ID:116756524).
 Through clinical trials and registry data it has made a major contribution to the world-wide impact
 of novel psoriasis therapies (Griffiths, Lancet.2015:REF2ID:38793134) and their optimal use


                                                                                               Page 18
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 (Warren, J.Invest.Derm.2018:REF2ID:63088344). It has introduced novel care pathways
 including educating and empowering patients through initiatives such as Psoriasis Shout Out.
 Skin ageing (Watson): Linking with photobiology and employing FBMH’s Core Laboratory
 Facilities (3.6) has defined key molecular (Watson, Redox.Biol.2015:REF2ID:38937920) and
 structural mechanisms (Watson, Mech.Age.Develop.2016:REF2ID:64766048) behind the
 appearance and mechanical function (Sherratt, J.Pathol.2020:REF2ID:177106532) of aged skin,
 informing development of novel topical therapies.
 Future Research
 CfDR’s future research develops three existing and one new theme:
 UV Radiation Effects. Research will investigate UV radiation “best balance for health” expanding
 Rhodes’ UV/vitamin D sufficiency/deficiency (£450k) and Marais’ melanomagenesis (£2.1m)
 studies.
 Skin biology and ageing. Watson’s Wallgreens-Boots-Alliance funded (£3.8m) skin
 homeostasis research, enriched by the Skin Proteome Study (Sherratt £1.5m), a ground-breaking
 bioinformatics-augmented systematic literature review, will uncover new understanding of skin
 disease and inform Saunder’s Wellcome-funded skin inflammation work,
 Psoriasis. PSORT (£7m) generated a collaborative which, employing at-scale examination of
 psoriasis subgroups, using the NIHR Bioresource and BADBIR, will feed into Yiu’s NIHR-funded
 Fellowship investigating responses to and adverse effects of biologics; and BRC Dermatology
 Theme-funded multimorbidity research improving psoriasis sufferers’ lives through: personalised
 medicine. With KCL, we will expand the COVID-19-psoriasis global registries to gain further insight
 into interplay between these two diseases.
 Atopic dermatitis. Building on early basic science (Arkwright, J.All.Clin.Immunol.2020:
 REF2ID:178183460), Saunders’ Wellcome funding (£950k), upcoming clinical trials of novel
 therapeutics, and participation in the eczema BADBIR-equivalent, A-STAR, we will bring atopic
 dermatitis into our discovery-to-translation research portfolio.

 1.6.9 INFECTION (8.2 FTE)
 Background
 UoA1’s research specifically focused on infection has been largely directed towards fungal
 infection. In 2020 we extended our research to include: SARS-COV inflammasome for
 stratification and outcome predictions; (1.6.5, 1.10); and antibiotic stewardship to combat
 resistance.
 Major Research Themes
 Aspergillus Research: UoA1 academics in the National Aspergillosis Centre (world’s largest
 fungal respiratory research and treatment centre) have explored the wider epidemiology of
 aspergillosis (Rautemaa-Richardson, Lancet.Inf.Dis.2018:REF2ID:75966231), discovered
 novel mechanisms underlying the behaviour of aspergillus in-vivo (Bertuzzi,
 PLOS.Pathogen.2014:REF2ID:38652843; Denning, Nature.Comms.2018:REF2ID:82649733);
 and     defined    drug    resistance   mechanisms.    (Bromley,    Nature.Comms.2020:
 REF2ID:158591821). By working with industry partners NAC has developed, trialled and
 translated    important   monitoring  tools   (Kosmidis,    Antimicro.Agent.Chemo.2020:
 REF2ID:178191103), and novel therapeutics, into clinical care, changing Aspergillosis
 management on a global scale (Denning, REF3 Impact Case)


                                                                                            Page 19
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 Future Research
 Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis: affects >6m people worldwide. Invasive aspergillosis
 threatens cancer chemotherapy programmes, and solid organ/stem cell transplantation.
 Bromley’s basic research on invasion (MRC £560k) and fungal genomics (Wellcome £770k) will
 inform novel anti-fungal strategies in developed and developing countries.
 Antibiotic stewardship Management, combatting resistance: This will bring a second infection
 theme into the NW Lung Centre. The newly formed (2020) NIHR Centre for Precision Approaches
 to Combatting Antimicrobial Resistance (£4.4m) will use existing antibiotics better in individualised
 treatments. It will define patient-specific approaches to antibiotic stewardship by employing big
 data analytics on patient-derived metrics, infection biomarkers (Dark £1.8m; NIHR), and outcome
 data, to refine anti-bacterial prescribing.

 TECHNOLOGY-BASED GROUPS
 In collaboration with researchers in UoM’s Faculty of Science and Engineering (FSE), we have
 built two Research Groups that address diagnosis and therapeutics through harnessing
 technological advances to IDSAI’s powerful big data analytics.

 1.6.10. BIOMARKER TECHNOLOGIES (BiomTech) (8.2 FTE)
 Background
 In 2013 MRC described a significant failure to translate MRC-funded biomarker discoveries into
 clinical products. BiomTech, was formed in response.
 Major Research Themes
 BiomTech has two discovery arms:
 Manchester Centre for Cancer Biomarker Sciences (MCCBS: Dive). A CRUK Centre of
 Excellence (CRUK £3.5m; BRC £700k; AstraZeneca £11m) MCCBS has refined liquid biopsy
 assays and xenograft models for target validation (Dive, Cancer.Discov.2016:
 REF2ID:51171905),    optimising     patient  stratification (Brady,     Nature.Med.2016:
 REF2ID:51526225), and informing patient management across a spectrum of cancers.
 Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre (SBDC Whetton) £12.8m MRC infrastructure funding
 matched from SCIEX, Stoller Foundation and BRC. Housed in purpose-built facilities in
 Citylabs1.0, it is the largest discovery proteomics centre in Europe. It has undertaken key research
 informing: technology behind biomarker discovery (Whetton, Nature.Protocol.2015:
 REF2ID:39034142);          patient    stratification; and     therapeutic     advances    (Whetton,
 Bioinformatics.2020:REF2ID:158123299); in cancer (Whetton, J.Proteome.Res.2019:
 REF2ID:158123315), inflammatory diseases and psychiatric disorders.
 A single-point-of-contact translational pipeline.
 Manchester Molecular Pathology Innovation Centre (MMPathIC Freemont) established by
 MRC/EPSRC (£2.9m), facilitates development and clinical translation for academic and industry
 biomarker discoveries, through: early health economic evaluation (with health economists [Payne,
 Thompson, UoA2] and health informatician [Geifman, UoA2]); partnering with appropriate
 clinicians; assisting with acquiring funding from grant funders and venture capitalists; and
 navigating testing and regulatory processes, to deliver market-ready products. Robust testing in
 real healthcare settings is enhanced by co-ordinated roll-out across GM’s post-DevoManc
 landscape.


                                                                                              Page 20
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 During REF2021 MMPathIC:
   Facilitated taking 14 new research-derived biomarkers into clinical use (e.g. gene-based brain
    tumour diagnostics, urinary metabolites of antihypertensives, sensitive methotrexate assay,
    early bladder cancer cytology diagnostic)
   Assisted seven companies from: UK: APIS Technologies (4.4), and SMEs Gelmetix,
    Chromition, DeepMed I/O), USA: Singulex, France: Kurma Diagnostics; Australia: Sienna
    Diagnostics; to identify market niches and commercialise products.
 Specific examples: Assessed validated Singulex Ultrahigh sensitivity Troponin-I assay for
 myocardial injury, and diagnostic platform (Freemont); Supported Chromition in grant applications
 (SBRI, Innovate-UK) securing £2m funding for evaluation of novel multiplexed
 immunohistochemistry disclosing systems (Freemont); with EPSRC funding, patented and
 developed to clinical trial a graphene biosensor (patent: GB1809160.3) for lung disease
 breathomics (Migliorato [UoA12]);
 MMPathIC was described at review by MRC’s Stratified Medicine Group as “impressive and
 successful, has achieved cultural change”.
 Future Research
 We will build on our technology base to drive the biomarker discovery essential for patient
 stratification and personalised medicine, creating opportunities for novel biomarker discovery-
 based projects (e.g. ID Liver started Q3 2020 £4.5m Innovate/Industry)
 Advances in “omics” technology such as those pioneered by MCCBS, SBDC, Genetics and CfMR
 coupled to technological advances made in UoM Institutes (e.g. “wearables”, nanoscale sensors)
 will generate unique opportunities to discover and clinically translate novel biomarkers through
 MMPathIC’s adoption pipeline, enabled by HInM, leveraging resource through UoM’s £2.4m
 Wellcome Institutional Translational Partnership, and £25m Pankhurst Institute (4.1).

 1.6.11. REGENERATIVE MEDICINE (RegenMed 13 FTE)
 Background
 RegenMed is the clinically-focused arm of the cross-faculty Manchester Regenerative Medicine
 Network (91 academics from FBMH/FSE [REF2021 funding: £104m]).
 RegenMed made basic mechanistic discoveries that feed in to the clinical use, alone or in
 combination, of a spectrum of technologies directed towards restoring tissue functionality, crossing
 disciplines, organs and diseases with the shared goal of technology-driven improvement in patient
 wellbeing.
 Major Research Themes
 Stem cell manipulation to restore tissue/organ structure and/or function e.g. myocardium
 (Birket,    Nature.Biotech.2015:REF2ID:85187571),        skeletal     muscle     (Cossu,
 EMBO.Mol.Med.2015:REF2ID:51514383 and EMBO.Mol.Med.2015:REF2ID:51514382), kidney
 (Lennon, Stem.Cell.Rep.2018:REF2ID:64334356), and brain (Bigger, EMBO.Mol.Med.2020:
 REF2ID:159841487).
 Gene and biologic therapies. Bigger’s research on enzyme replacement, now rolled out with
 industry partners, has completely changed the lives of children and young adults with
 mucopolysaccharidosis (Bigger, REF3 impact case);
 Understanding and managing the disease “niche” (physical, cellular and chemical disease
 environment) employing technologies including transcriptomics (Herrick, J.Pathol.2018:


                                                                                             Page 21
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 REF2ID:76553857),      mechanotransduction       (Richardson,    Nature.Comms.2019:
 REF2ID:131625790) and clock biology (Hoyland, Ann.Rheum.Dis.2017:REF2ID:50943914).
 Advanced biomaterials: With Biomaterials (UoA12) and, latterly, Royce Institute, MIB, and the
 Graphene Institute, has generated purpose-engineered clinically valuable matrices and scaffolds
 by designing (Freemont, Soft.Matter.2016:REF2ID:50401988), clinically trialing (“Polynerve”:
 First-in-man NIHR-funded phase-I trial of a synthetic polymer nerve conduit in patients with digital
 nerve injury), and safety testing (Pennock, ACS.Nano.2020: REF2ID:174502187) completely
 novel biomaterials.
 Tissue engineering; using cells, biologics and scaffold to generate new tissues in-vivo (Biant,
 Health.Technol.Assess.2017:REF2ID:64760718).
 Future Research
 Novel niche-specific biomaterials: Recent formation of the >£200m Henry Royce Institute
 (4.1.2) will bring closer collaboration between RegenMed academics and engineers, delivering
 novel biomaterials for augmenting, replacing and regenerating failing organs. Commercialisation
 will be through the £25m Pankhurst Institute guided by upscaling experience from “Polynerve” and
 Gelmetix (UoM spin-out 2012)
 Regulating the disease environment: Through MaRMN we will cross-fertilise innovative
 methods of regulating disease niches to restore niche biology or slow/prevent progress of
 diseases, building on our experience of: nanodelivery of biologics (vs Arthritis £1.2m), gene
 therapy (MRC £600k), stem cell delivery (MRC £1.5m), and model systems (EPSRC £700k) to
 translate discovery into therapeutics.
 Innovation in treating genetic disease: Bigger’s pioneering mucopolysaccharidosis enzyme
 replacement and gene therapy is a paradigm for other inherited disorders. Already translating into
 muscular dystrophies, and renal disorders, we will expand our activities into other systems.

 1.6.12. MEDICAL HUMANITIES (MedHum: 12 FTE)
 Background
 MedHum exemplifies how diversification of research can impact direction and delivery of clinical
 medicine and instil understanding of the value and critical interpretation of clinical research.
 Major Research Themes
 Centre for History of Science, Technology and Medicine (CHSTM). UK’s largest research
 group engaged with integrated historical studies of medicine, science and technology. CHSTM
 enhances UoA1’s research through contextualising clinical and experimental medicine within
 wider historical, social, political and global contexts. CHSTM is a Wellcome Cluster of Excellence.
 CHSTM has overlapping interests with academics returned in History (UoA28).
 CHSTM academics have:
 Changed understanding of how historical studies of healthcare can be undertaken, and data
  analysed and used to change future delivery.
   Employed text mining to enrich data retrieval/analysis from archival material (Timmerman,
    PLoS.One.2016 REF2ID:156081072)
   Award winning Public Patient Involvement (PPI) research:
       • Examined the NHS’ history (Snow’s ongoing online project “NHS@70”, created first oral
         history of the NHS, and second largest collection in British Library Sound Archive,
         stimulating the NHS to use historical evidence when developing policy and practice)

                                                                                             Page 22
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
       • Defined and the role of migration in shaping and enhancing NHS workforce (Snow
         Doctors Beyond Borders 2016, REF2ID:64687762).
   Analysed how industry shaped healthcare and legislation (Greco Soc.Sci.Med.2015:
    REF2ID:134063706)
 Contextualised forensic science and criminology (Burney, Wilson, Book: “Murder and the
 Making of English CSI”, 2016:REF2ID:156080601 (For work in this field Burney was awarded a
 Guggenheim Fellowship [2019])
 Explored the history, value and ethics behind animal-based research, shaping future debate
 and policy (Kirk, Sci.Technol.Hum.Values.2017:REF2ID:62519735; Wilson, Book: Making of
 British Bioethics 2014:REF2ID:46405056)
 Evaluated and critiqued external events that have changed science, medicine and health; e.g.
 climate change (Jankovic Weather.Climate.Society.2017:REF2ID:50935639)
 Research within Medical Education (RME) uses its own research and that of others to develop
 student understanding of designing and analysing healthcare research using qualitative and
 quantitative techniques. RME academics have:
   Altered understanding of psychological and physical impacts of healthcare environments on
    healthcare workers and students (Hart, Med.Education.2014:REF2ID:38793691) and
    measured and evaluated the impact of health education on healthcare delivery in low-income
    countries (Byrne-Davis, J.Nurs.Ed.Pract.2015:REF2ID:38657045).
   Have influenced UoM’s medical students to initiate and undertake their own research:
     • Manchester Medical Research Student Society won Academy of Medical Sciences Inspire
       Awards in 2014, 2018 and 2020;
     • Manchester’s Madagascar Medical Expeditions (MADEX, founded 2014 and run by
       medical students [and now graduated MADEX students]) through annual expeditions
       maintains ongoing research programmes studying Malagasy children living with
       schistosomiasis. For his research, founder Stephen Spencer was awarded a SEE’s Rivers
       Foundation Explorer Award and RCP Turner-Warwick lectureship (2019 Yearbook)
 Future Research
 CHSTM: The societal and political background to NHS delivery has been brought into sharp focus
 by Covid-19. There will be lessons learnt to improve healthcare delivery that CHSTM researchers
 are uniquely placed to contextualise. This research potential was recently (8/20) spotlighted by
 Snow’s team’s award of £1m AHRC grant “NHS voices of Covid-19”. They, in partnership with
 the NHS, patients, wider public, and British Library, will examine: how the pandemic has altered
 public attitudes to the NHS; what “care” means; and who provides “care”.
 RME: COVID management and outcomes also emphasise the significance to clinicians of
 evidenced health policy and healthcare provision and delivery, further consolidating Byrne-Davis
 and Hart’s research (£400k) illustrating the need to empower clinicians to objectively evaluate
 clinical data using a breadth of techniques.
 1.7 Animal Research: Embracing 3Rs Principles
 Kirk (MedHum) researches the contextual and moral landscape of animal research from within
 Wellcome’s Animal Research Nexus: “Changing Constitutions of Science, Health and Welfare”.
 All UoA1 researchers work within an award-winning animal research environment. In 2016 UoM’s
 animal research website, which publishes ethics committee minutes, welfare policies, governance
 information, infographics on number/species of animals, and studies on medical advances arising

                                                                                         Page 23
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 from animal and 3Rs research, received an Openness Award from Understanding Animal
 Research (UAR), the judges concluding: “Information is accessible and appropriate to a wide
 range of audiences, layered and easy to navigate. Material was extensive and of an excellent
 standard, and infographic and Q&A sections particularly impressive."
 The website contributes to UoM’s engagement activities with local schools, media, patients and
 the public that in 2018 received the National Centre for Public Engagement Gold Watermark
 Award. In 2019, UoM was in UAR’s top 10 organisations for animal research.

 1.8 Research Openness
 We work within UoM’s Open Research Environment (REF5a.2v): see subsections: 1.6.12, 1.7
 (animal research); 3.9 (Library-based researcher training); 2.4.4 (medical education): 4.3 (PPI)
 UoM makes Open Access (OA) funds available from UKRI (£1.2m) and Wellcome (£170k) block
 grants and UoM’s OA Fund (£300k). The Library has arranged OA memberships and agreements
 with several publishers securing reduced or waived APCs.
 The University-wide Open Research Working Group, arranges training events and workshops
 around Open and Reproducible Research, and feeds directly into the UK Reproducibility Network

 1.9 Best Research Practice
 Contributing to, and managing research, comes with responsibility to ensure its probity, quality
 and ethical base. UoM governs standards, fostering the highest levels of research integrity within
 a research culture that values knowledge-creation for: its own sake; potential benefits to
 humankind; and enrichment of higher learning (REF5a.2v).
 UoA1’s research governance is remitted by UoM’s Research Governance Team (RGT) which also
 supports researchers undertaking NHS-based research.
 Acting for UoM as Research Governance Sponsor, RGT ensures researchers and UoM meet the
 UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research’s requirements. RGT works closely
 with individual researchers, providing practical advice and sign-posts researchers navigating NHS
 research regulations.
 Within UoM, RGT works with the Research Governance, Ethics and Integrity Team ensuring
 alignment with the principles in Universities UK’s Concordat to Support Research Integrity.

 1.10 Research Response to Covid-19
 55% of UoA1 researchers are clinicians. Whilst the Covid-19 pandemic pressured clinical services,
 it brought opportunities to demonstrate the agility and innate collaboration in our research
 ecosystem when faced with major healthcare issues. Examples include:
   National Medicines Discovery Catapult at Alderley Park became one of three national
    “Lighthouse” Covid mega-testing laboratories. CRUK-MI scientists accelerated its launch by
    volunteering genomics skills. Klapper (Professor of Clinical Virology) is an advisor.
   3D printing of PPE (collaboration with School of Architecture [Clayton])
   Formation of “Covid-19 Rapid Response Research Group” (Bruce Chair): brokered by BRC,
    channelled research activity of scientists, clinical academics and MAHSC clinicians towards
    understanding the disease, and developing reliable tests and treatments. Key outputs include:



                                                                                           Page 24

    programme, evaluating coronavirus tests in clinical settings.
   Snow (CHSTM), awarded £1m (AHRC) to explore how patients’ attitudes towards the NHS
    have been changed by the pandemic
   UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium (Hussell, Theme Lead) awarded £6.5m from
    UKRI/NIHR investigating immune system-SARS-CoV-2 interactions.
   Following an appeal, £500k philanthropic donations received by FBMH for Covid-related
    research funds 10 pilot projects.
   GM Mass Testing Expert Group (MTEG) (Bruce co-Chair) includes UoA1 academics and
    NHS consultants/GPs to inform GMHSCP’s roll-out of testing technologies/programmes.
   Redmond (Emeritus Professor of International Emergency Medicine, Founder of UK-MED)
    led the medical team staffing Manchester’s 750 bed Nightingale Hospital
   Our BRC through Hanley is part of the MRC/NIHR Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study
    (£8.4m Leicester) and UK Interstitial Lung Disease Post-COVID19 Fibrosis (MRC £2.4m
    Nottingham) consortia, investigating the debilitating effects of “Long Covid”.
 Publications. Within 12 weeks of first lockdown, we had contributed to improved sector
 understanding of Covid-19’s healthcare impacts. 32 publications included: 4 basic science (Covid-
 19-induced inflammasome); 10 new descriptions of Covid-19 presentations in specific disease
 settings; and 18 management guidelines (Papadopoulos J.All.Clin.Immunol.2020:
 REF2ID:178171547), all with national and/or international collaborators, assisting clinicians safely
 manage Covid-19 in contexts as diverse as cardiac catheter laboratories, allergy clinics, childhood
 asthma , IMIDs, psoriasis and lung cancer.
 UoA1 published a further 59 papers on Covid-19-related issues from July-December.


 2. People

 2.1 Staffing Strategy
 UoA1 academics work within a supportive, structured, people-focused environment defined by
 UoM (REF5a.3). Briefly:


 2.1.1 Recruitment, development, and retention: During REF2021 we have recruited 129 new
 staff through external appointments and targeted fellowships, and appointment to internal
 fellowships and the NIHR ACL scheme. We fully encompass the Researcher Development
 Concordat (UoM holds the EU HR Excellence in Research badge, retained since 2011),
 continuously updated by staff input through research staff networks and biennial Staff Survey.



                                                                                             Page 25
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 2.1.2 Equality and Diversity: UoA1 recruits the best candidates based on merit.
 UoM has the bronze Race Equality Charter Mark, and is signatory to the Disability Confident
 Scheme and Stonewall Diversity Champions Programme. In FBMH Athena Swan and Project
 JUNO dedicated roles are embedded across research management.
 SBS/SMS have Athena Swan silver status (2018), the assessors reporting: “The submission
 demonstrated commitment and engagement in the process from all levels…. The panel
 considered it to be a clear and reflective submission…it was clear how staff were communicated
 with throughout the process of restructuring. Good use was made of the “Further Information”
 section to discuss…support available to staff and students following the Paterson fire”.
 There are flexible return-to-work programmes for those returning from long-term parental and
 sickness leave, including tapered return and short-term reduction in teaching activities.
 Of our 12 Research Group Leads five are women. This positive change from REF2014 (no female
 leads) is part of an upward trajectory, further evidenced by increasingly gender-balanced Chair
 promotions (13% female REF2014 to 45% REF2021). 11% of academics have a BAME
 background; double that at REF2014 (5.5%). Those with reported physical disabilities increased
 from 1 to 2.
 2.1.3 Continuous staff development enhances careers through: the “Researcher Development
 Framework”, guiding career development and training; annual Performance and Development
 Review through face-to-face interview with trained principal investigators; >1000 comprehensive
 training programmes; “Investing in Success” (funds innovative career development); and “Inspiring
 Leaders Programme”.
 2.1.4 Recognition and reward come through the annual promotions processes. Staff are
 supported in building promotion cases through workshops, School/Divisional promotion
 champions, and shared online experiences, leading to year-on-year increases in promotion
 success (e.g. for UoA1 between 2015 and 2019 successful applicants increased from 81% to
 88%). Critically the process accommodates career-breaks and part-time working.
 2.1.5 Careers of researchers on short/fixed-term contracts. Including our 22 ACLs, 48
 Research Fellows and 115 postdoctoral researchers, researchers on short/fixed term are
 supported by UoM’s sector-leading, open-ended contract policy carrying additional benefits after
 4yrs continuous service, including: 3 months’ salary beyond statutory notice periods; development
 opportunities (additional training, job shadowing); 6mths redeployment, bridging gaps in funding;
 Extended Access Policy (applauded in feedback on UoM’s HR Excellence in Research award
 renewal 2017) providing 12mths access to email and e-resources after contract termination.

 2.2. Staff Support and Development Structures
 Institution-wide support (aquamarine in Figure 3) includes: staff and student mentorship
 programmes; Staff Learning and Development Unit; Award-winning University Careers Service;
 Library-based researcher information including researcher profiles and key altmetric data.
 In addition FBMH has responsibility for staff development, supporting/mentoring at all career
 stages through its Researcher Development Continuum (RDC). It adds to the University
 programmes support tailored to the specific needs of its staff. Key to delivering this are specialised
 Support Services including:
   Research Strategy and Innovation Team (RS&I, 3.4)
   Centre for Academic Researcher Development (CARD)


                                                                                               Page 26
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
   Three teams support research students and ECRs, Doctoral Academy (DA), Fellowship
    Academy (FA): and Integrated Clinical Academic Training (ICAT) Team.
 2.3. Research Development Continuum RDC)
 RDC is the overarching support framework for all UoA1 researchers from students to senior
 academics. It offers different support programmes specifically designed to take into account the
 seniority of individual researchers and their immediate and future needs. Figure 4 shows when
 and how specialist support is offered and how it complements UoM-wide support. FBMH’s
 Researcher Development Group co-ordinates development provision, ensuring equality of access
 and opportunity delivered through Schools/Divisions and CARD.




 CARD delivers coaching and mentoring to UoA1 researchers, students and honorary staff,
 enabling personalised professional development. It includes:
   New Academics Programme (NAP) for all new staff below Professor. Accredited by
    Advance-HE, NAP is flexible, dovetailing with academics’ career aspirations and prior
    experience, supporting research, teaching, learning and leadership. Successful completion
    leads to HEA Fellowship.
   Faculty Leadership Programme. A two year programme promoting exceptional academic
    leadership through example and education, enhancing research capability, teaching and
    learning best practice, leadership and management capacity, personal effectiveness, and
    strategic career management.



                                                                                         Page 27

   With DA, provides training support at key stages of postgraduate degrees ensuring timely
    completion, and generic skills development.
   Researchers Development Programme provides intermediate level training maximising
    outputs and impact, developing transferable skills and independent research careers,
    proactive career management, CV development, interview skills, and academic/non-
    academic career planning.
   Administering UoA1’s Academic/Research Staff mentoring programme, enhancing
    performance and fulfilling potential for individual researchers through 12 months mentoring.
   Convening FBMH’s Research Staff Representatives Forum a network of 30+ Research
    Staff Representatives who promote the interests of 1060+ FBMH researchers.

 2.4. Developing Tomorrow’s Researchers
 We place particular emphasis on recruitment and retention for the future, through three specialist
 support units.
 2.4.1 ICAT (Lennon)
 ICAT works closely with NIHR’s Trainees’ Coordinating Centre, overseeing ‘Integrated Academic
 Training’. ICAT is currently supporting 85 ACFs/ACLs.
 Full monitoring of career progression is conducted with NW Deanery. Since inception, 65% of
 ACFs have progressed to PhD programmes or take up ACL posts compared with a reported 47%
 nationally (2015 data).
 With Bristol, Leeds and Newcastle, ICAT is undertaking systematic evidence review to understand
 why women are lost from clinical research careers.
 2.4.2 Fellowship Academy (Hanley, White)
 FA supports researchers to obtain external fellowships. From 2016-2019 externally funded “junior”
 fellowships increased from 7 to 13/year. Researchers access: “CV clinics”, bespoke advice and
 peer review, mock interviews, pump-prime funding, and Institutional Fellowship awards including:
 ECR Development Award; Dean’s Prize for Clinicians; and Presidential Fellowships.
 Post-award, fellows are closely mentored within Divisions, clinical Fellows by at least one clinical
 academic from her/his Research Group. Career guidance is provided through dialogue with senior
 colleagues, formalised Faculty-level objective setting and mid-term review.
 FA manages the “Fellows Network” providing peer support, networking and collaboration
 opportunities.
 2.4.3 Doctoral Academy
 DA, managed at Divisional level, ensures: students have comprehensive academic and pastoral
 support; provides online training (particularly attractive to part-time students) in core skills (£5m
 UoM funding); promotes wellbeing initiatives; manages successful “PGR Parents’ and Partners”
 groups, providing peer support for students and their families (particularly appreciated by
 international students); and “Student Representative Network”, promoting integration with peers
 and key postgraduate staff; offers conference and society membership funding; actively supports
 outstanding undergraduates to enter masters and doctoral programmes; hosts public engagement
 activities and external speakers, enhancing student networking.

Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 2.4.4 Research Students
 Medical Undergraduates (UG): A research ethos is embedded in UoM’s medical undergraduates
 (~2400 across all years) from day one. 10% of the programme is timetabled for “skill-driven
 research”, students learning generic research skills (critiquing publications, producing posters etc.)
 whilst engaged on research projects with academics.
 Annually: ~100 students present at major conferences; ~20 publish in Medline-indexed journals,
 ~170 students intercalate (choosing from a pool of 39 Bachelor/Masters level programmes,
 offering students new skills and a robust foundation for academic careers); and ~25 take up
 Academic Foundation Posts.
 2019/2020 awards from CRUK and the Kennedy Foundation will fund five innovative MB-PhD
 studentships/year starting in 2021, supporting aspiring clinician scientists to obtain PhDs in cancer
 or musculoskeletal/inflammatory diseases between years 3-4 of their UG studies.
 Postgraduate Taught Students. We manage and/or deliver teaching in 22 MSc, MRes and MPhil
 programmes. In PRES 2019 our students’ overall satisfaction was 82.4% up 2.9% from 2017.
 Postgraduate Research (PGR) Students: Within DA’s framework, from 2014-2020, we
 supervised 736 doctoral students to successful degree award (interdisciplinary supervision
 equates to our being credited with 549.62FTE). We currently supervise 998 doctoral students.
 During REF2021 we have been awarded new, externally funded programmes supporting 35
 students/year:
   Multidisciplinary 4 year PhD programmes: Wellcome: 4ward North Clinical PhD Academy;
    Immune-matrix interactions: EPSRC-funded DTCs: Tissue Repair and Regeneration;
    Advanced Biomedical Materials; BHF: Cardiovascular Sciences: BRC: Trans-discipline
    studentships
   DClinSci programme managed through Manchester Academy for Healthcare Scientist
    Education (MAHSE). Launched in 2016, MAHSE’s Higher Specialist Scientist Training
    (HSST) Programme includes five-year workplace-based training, incorporates a Doctorate in
    Clinical Sciences, and, where appropriate, Royal College qualifications. Currently there are
    81 UoA1-supervised students.
 Recruitment: Standardised selection processes include project and supervisory team
 assessment by DA, and panel interviews. We place particular importance on meeting healthcare
 professionals’ expectations and needs.
 Recognising challenges in recruiting non-medical graduates into clinical research our BRC and
 ARC support 6-week ‘taster’ sessions for NHS professionals to experience research
 environments. Of the first 19 (2018-20), six are currently seeking funding opportunities.
 Student progress and monitoring: PGR students undertake online progression monitoring,
 providing clarity on critical milestones, and record evidence of engagement with training, progress
 and personal development. This ensures continual supervisory feedback, and timely thesis
 submission and degree completion.
 Experience and Careers: UoA1 students are advised by UoM’s award-winning Career Service,
 specialising in bespoke careers training, CV writing workshops and networking events with
 industry.
 Through DA, PGR students, assess performance against publication quality (not number), give
 presentations at pan-School Research Showcases and obtain grounding in disseminating and
 communicating research to the wider community.

 Professional Training: We play key roles in discipline-specific professional postgraduate training
 and delivery of key national clinical education programmes (4.8)
 2.4.5. Early career researchers (ECRs)
 UoA1 ECRs’ career progression is facilitated through: NAP; CARD; supervision; mentorship; and
 reduced teaching/management responsibilities for 4yrs, ensuring a sound research base and clear
 direction. Returning 39 ECRs (17% of eligible staff) reflects the vitality of our research
 environment.

 2.5 Metrics of Recruitment and Retention Success
 Key metrics evidence the success of our staffing strategy over REF2021 in attracting and retaining
 quality researchers. For instance:
   External esteem (4.8) (20 prestigious awards [FRS, FMedSci, OBEs, NIHR-SIs); 46 visiting
    professorships, 101 grant panel members, six presidents of International Societies)
   Research income: (13 new externally funded research centres; grant expenditure/year/FTE
    increased 19%);
   114 external Fellowships/personal Awards (2.9);
   ECR recruitment (17% of returned academics);
   Research driving change in hospital/community healthcare delivery. (Based on our clinical
    research, during REF2021, NHS/NIHR has established and funds six new integrated
    research and treatment centres (1.2)
   Output quality (examples in 1.6.1-1.6.12).
 In the Times Higher Education (THE) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Impact rankings
 2020, for SDG3: Good Health and Well-being measures UoM ranked 26th globally and 3rd in UK.

 2.6 Integration between clinical and basic scientists
 The number of clinically qualified and basic scientists is balanced across Research Groups
 optimising complementary skill sets. In UoA1 55% of researchers are clinical scientists and 45%
 basic scientists.

 2.7 Consultancy
 Academics may undertake up to 10% of their contracted time on consultancy duties, allowing them
 to increase research activity through interactions with industry partners (4.4) and University spin-
 outs (4.5). There has been a 30% increase in industry funding/FTE/year since REF2014, and
 between REF2014 and REF2021 an increase in filed patents from 16 to 102 and licence
 agreements from 6 to 54.

 2.8 Recruitment during REF2021
 21% of UoA1 researchers have been external appointments, either directly to senior academic
 posts (senior lecturer and above), or targeted prestigious Fellowships (included in 2.9)

 3.3. Securing Future Funding
 Our future funding will build on REF2021 successes, align with our future research strategy, and
 the aspirations of individual Groups. The principles that will drive future funding are:
   Exploiting the unique resources within Manchester to access and translate bioinformatic and
    digital insights, into clinical care and personalised medicine. We will harness:
     • Hospital-based Clinical e-records;
     • GM’s Integrated Care Records across primary, secondary and tertiary care;
     • NIHR Health Informatics Collaboratives
     • UoA1’s polyomics, and polyomic data sets from our Research Groups (SBDC, Genetics
       etc.), and those in the public domain
     • The power of UoM’s big data analytics (e.g. IDSAI and Digital Futures Platform)
     to mine data from all these sources at scale and speed, enabling identification of novel
     biomarkers, and therapeutic targets, and to power personalised medical innovation with
     genuine global relevance.
   Working within UoM, lead and/or participate in cross-cutting, trans-Faculty strategic
    initiatives, to view medical problems and their solutions from new angles.
   Maintaining competitive streams of ECRs, doctoral students and fellows, to bring us
    challenging ideas and ensure seamless succession.
   Renewing our BRC with more funded Themes, building on its successes, and incorporating
    emergent clinical research areas that would benefit from a BRC’s integrated support
    environment.
   Using DevoManc; HInM; our local government’s vision; new infrastructure delivered by MSP,
    UoM, and NHS; and our in-house discovery-to-clinical implementation pipelines to attract new

 3.4. Research Support
 FBMH’s RS&I facilitates our research by enabling interdisciplinarity; disseminating strategic
 funding intelligence; analysing datasets to inform strategic developments; and supporting
 partnering, research projects, consultancy, knowledge exchange, and facility-sharing.

 3.5 Trans-sector Infrastructure and Facilities Used by UoA1 Researchers
 UoM’s investment strategy focuses resource, knowledge and skills in Beacons, Institutes and
 Platforms, specialist facilities and strategic units that can be accessed by all academics. This
 empowers collaborative, quality research, and is highly resource efficient (REF5a). This strategy
 is embraced by our NHS and local government partners resulting in multi-funder initiatives such
 as the new Paterson Building (3.5.3).
 3.5.1 UoA1’s research is based in 4 UoM campus buildings and 3 Hospital Trusts.
 UoM, MFT and Manchester Science Park are co-located along the ”Oxford Road Health and Life
 Sciences Corridor” (ORC) a 1sq mile Local Economic Partnership (LEP)-designated innovation
 quarter. In addition to UoM, MFT and the Science Park, ORC contains 50% of Manchester’s Life
 Science businesses, and is amongst Europe’s largest clinical academic campuses.
 UoA1 researchers work within the heart of this environment in: four inter-connected UoM
 buildings (AV Hill, Michael Smith, Stopford, Core Technology Facility [MCCIR, RegenMed,
 MedHum]); and MFT “Oxford Road” (4 Hospitals with dedicated clinical and laboratory research
 facilities: Manchester Royal Infirmary [MRI: Genetics, CVS, CfMR], St Mary’s Womens’
 Hospital, Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital [RMCH] together hosting DBM, and the Royal
 Manchester Eye Hospital [Ophthalmic Genetics]).
 The remainder of our researchers are within five miles of the ORC in specialty-specific, purpose-
 built, integrated research and clinical facilities within NHS Trusts:
   Christie campus (Cancer): Christie Hospital (dedicated research, biobank, and radiotherapy
    facilities); Oglesby Building; new Paterson Institute.
   MFT “Wythenshawe”: Specialist NW Lung Centre (RespMed, Infection)
   Salford Royal Hospitals: Specialist GM Dermatology Centre: (CfDR)
 3.5.2: Manchester Science Partnership (MSP)
 MSP, a strategic partnership (UoM, MFT, Bruntwood [major local construction and business
 premises management company], MMU, and Manchester, Salford and East Cheshire Councils)
 focuses on growing Manchester’s knowledge economy by providing specialist laboratory and
 office environments and support services purpose-designed for science and technology along
 ORC.
 MSP has significantly enabled UoA1 by bringing hi-tech business to Manchester and siting them
 in proximity with UoA1 researchers in state-of-the-art buildings on the Science Park, and “Citylabs”
 in MFT.
 In 2014 MSP acquired the life science campus at Alderley Park. Currently undergoing £247m
 investment, it offers high specification lab space; range of scientific services; and an accelerator
 delivering comprehensive programmes of business support for start-ups/scale-ups. It is home to
 a fast growing community of >60 established and 150 pre-start-up companies.




                                                                                             Page 37
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 3.5.3 Headline examples of infrastructure investment since REF2014:
 New Build (completed)

    state-of-the-art cancer research laboratories (£38m: CRUK/UoM/UKRPIF).
   National Graphene Institute (£61m; £38m EPSRC, £23m EU). A trans-faculty collaborative
    facility for sector-leading research on 2D materials where UoA1 researchers, in collaboration,
    develop ground-breaking biomaterials and biosensors.
   Citylabs1.0 (£25m). Brings together UoA1 researchers, NHS, and industry. Houses
    MMPathIC, SBDC and industrial partners including APIS and Yourgene.
   BCMRR (£3.1m). MFT Wythenshawe site within NW Lung Centre
 New Build (under construction)
   Paterson Redevelopment Project: Following the 2017 fire that destroyed CRUK-MI’s
    Paterson Building, a new, larger £150m Research Centre is taking shape on the Christie site,
    accommodating biomedical research laboratories, consultant workspace, collaboration
    spaces, and support facilities, and promoting collaborations between cancer researchers and
    clinicians.
 Refurbishment
   Vaughan House: Campus listed building refurbished (£2.4m MRC) for Manchester Health
    Informatics Hub of the Northern England Health eResearch Centre. Promotes cutting-edge
    research consolidating e-health records and apposite research data.
   5th floor AV Hill: The 9,700m² AV Hill building was future-proofed, leaving the 5th floor
    shelled. Reflecting UoA1’s increasing research, in 2015 it was populated with modern
    laboratories, write-up rooms and office accommodation (£2.8m).
   Alderley Park: Built by AstraZeneca, this complex, extensively refurbished by MSP, now
    houses UoA1 spin outs, other start-ups, larger organisations (Medicine’s Discovery Catapult,
    Infex Therapeutics) and (currently) CRUK-MI.
   Microbiology/Virology Laboratory Suite: on the Science Park site provides high quality
    laboratory space for use by infection researchers, and has fed into antibiotic stewardship and
    Covid-19 research. (£1m)

 3.6 Core Research Facilities Enabling Discovery Research
 FBMH’s Core Laboratory Facilities (CLFs) maximise the effectiveness of our discovery research
 through skilled technology-specific Experimental Officers (EOs).
 FBMH’s Research Technology Development Group oversees nine CLFs: Bioimaging; Biological
 Mass Spectrometry; Biomolecules; EM; Flow Cytometry; Genomic Technologies; Genome
 Editing; Histology; Proteomics.
 CLFs have grown since 2014 through >£15m institutional/grant investment in established and
 emerging technologies, staff increasing from 33 (2014) to 49 (2020). Researcher-perceived value
 is reflected in turnover (<£2m (2013/14) to ~£3.5m (2019/20). Increased impact through
 investment is exemplified by Genome Editing, historically focused on transgenic animals, but
 through Wellcome ISSF funding now incorporates CRISPR technology.
 To ensure CLFs meet researchers’ needs, horizon scanning through Groups, and researcher
 feed-in informs strategy.

                                                                                          Page 38
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 FBMH has preclinical Core Imaging Facilities (CIFs) and shares clinical CIFs with NHS partners,
 offering preclinical and clinical PET, MR and PET-MR imaging. Clinical research imaging is located
 in NHS partners (Christie, MFT Oxford Road, MFT Wythenshawe) and UoM’s Wolfson Molecular
 Imaging Centre (on the Christie site) which also houses specialist preclinical PET, MRI and CT
 facilities.

 3.7. Manchester Clinical Research Facility (NIHR MCRF)
 UoA1 researchers supported by FBMH’s £18m NIHR/CRUK grant-funded Clinical Trials Unit
 undertake trials in the NIHR MCRF (£12.5m. Director: Smith) comprising 4 experimental medicine
 units embedded within Christie Hospital and MFT (MRI, RMCH, Wythenshawe).
 Offering outpatient and 24/7 inpatient services, MCRF includes: dedicated pharmacy, laboratories,
 imaging suite, minor procedure suite, human performance laboratory, and, for children, play, multi-
 sensory, and “chill-out” rooms.
 Research studies increase year-on-year. Between 2017/8 and 2018/9 studies increased from 563
 to 688 in 2018/9, and phase I/II studies from 269 to 317, including: 24 from 5 BRC themes, phase-
 I study assessing safety/tolerability of a novel synthetic nerve repair conduit; TARGET trial: ctDNA
 informs stratification to cancer treatment trials.

 3.8. Biobanking Resources
 As well-characterised clinical material drives stratified/precision medicine research, we have
 expanded biobanks during REF2021. Examples include:
  MCRC Biobank collects fresh cancer samples from MAHSC Trusts. Holds >14,000 fully
  documented and consented tissue samples of human neoplasms, and pre-operative blood/urine.
  It also allows researchers to access thousands of stored histology samples through GM’s
  Pathology Network.
  MRC Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Disease Biobanks-UK (IMID-Bio-UK: £1.7m lead
  McInnes, Glasgow [UoA1 leads Griffiths, Bruce, Freemont]), links UoA1’s CfMR and CfDR
  biobanks with others nationally (in RA, lupus, psoriasis, primary biliary cholangitis, autoimmune
  hepatitis, Sjögren’s), through a single analysable dataset available to academic and industry
  researchers. This allows at-scale studies to: define disease mechanisms and drug actions;
  design improved clinical pathways; and identify therapeutic targets; across the IMID spectrum.
  Through BRC, UoA1 feeds into the NIHR Bioresource where Manchester leads the IMID
  Common Disease BioResource as well as a number of rare disease modules including
  neurofibromatosis-1 and -2, congenital hyperinsulinaemia and hereditary pulmonary fibrosis.
  Each MAHSC Trust (e.g. MFT Biobank) offers sample collection and banking services and
  UoA1 researchers maintain specialist in-house Biobanks (e.g. ManARTS [respiratory/allergy];
  Scleroderma and Raynaud’s; Placental blood and tissue)
  MMPathIC has developed initiatives for post-test samples (liquid and formalin-fixed paraffin-
  embedded tissue), routinely stored by NHS Trusts to be available to industry partners.
  UK Biobank (UKBB): UKBB Co-ordinating and Assessment Centre is located within GM. UoA1
  researchers work with UKBB (e.g. GWAS identifies novel chronotype loci in 100,420 individuals
  from UK Biobank. Ray. Nature.Comms.2016:REF2ID:51435206) through the Manchester
  UKBB Community, a researcher network for all using UKBB resources.



                                                                                             Page 39

 3.9 University Library, Key Underpinning Role in UoA1’s Research
 UoM’s Library’s extensive digital collection is amongst the Russell Group’s largest print and e-
 resource collections for biomedical sciences. This significant investment gives us seamless
 access to comprehensive discipline-specific collections, on and off campus.
 The Library supports our researcher journeys through Academic Engagement Librarians; research
 data management planning, Open Access compliance and managing online academic
 development pathways.

 3.10. Impact of Funding and Resourcing initiatives on UoA1’s Research
 Investment in infrastructure by UoM, UKRI, Research Charities, NHS and MSP has had profound,
 positive effects on: UoA1’s research environment; recruitment and retention of excellent
 researchers; impressions given to potential industry partners; and, thereby the amount and quality
 of UoA1’s research and its outputs.
 UoM’s strategy focusing on multidisciplinary research buildings and facilities and collaboration
 with partners, ensures key complex research activities can be professionally overseen by
 academics, EOs and technicians equipped with specialist knowledge, skills and physical resource,
 streamlining research and ensuring dependable results. This has proved to be cost- and time-
 effective, underpinning reliable, quality data.
 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society

 4.1. Changing Approaches to Healthcare Research though Collaborations within UoM
 UoM has a research infrastructure that facilitates multidisciplinary research. In addition to UoA1’s
 cross-disciplinary research groups made possible through Faculty restructure, research ideas,
 skills and facilities are available to all academics through a network of University Research
 Beacons, Institutes and Platforms.
 4.1.1 University Research Beacons embrace academic research and social responsibility by
 bringing together the best minds from different disciplines to address major modern world issues
 around Cancer, Advanced Materials, Global Inequalities, Energy and Industrial Biotechnology.
 UoA1 researchers lead Cancer and contribute clinical experience to Advanced Materials and
 Global Inequalities.
 4.1.2 University Institutes and Platforms concentrate skills and infrastructure in specialist areas.
 Constituent academics and their teams conduct their own research, whilst also acting as
 accessible sources of authoritative advice and specialised facilities that can be tapped by other
 researchers, ensuring grant applications are authoritative and realistic and research delivery
 optimal and efficient.
 We lead two (CRUK-MI and LBIII), and are integrated into eight more, as follows:
 CRUK Manchester Institute (CRUK-MI)
 Research in UoA1’s CRUK-MI underpins development of novel translational and personalised
 cancer medicine through discovery of key biological mechanisms, made available to cancer
 researchers world-wide.
 Lydia Becker Institute for Immunology and Inflammation (LBIII)
 Led by UoA1’s researchers, LBIII brings UoM’s immunology and inflammation researchers
 together, allowing multiple perspectives and approaches to be harnessed into unique

Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 collaborations. LBIII has 104 PIs/RFs (35% clinicians) and 191 PG students. Our Inflammation
 researchers benefit from LBIII’s discovery skills, whilst providing LBIII with clinical direction. We
 participate to Institute leadership through: Hussell (Director); Research Area Leads (Zelenay:
 Cancer; Kitmitto: Cardiovascular/multi-morbidities; Arkwright: Life course) and clinical
 immunology leads (Griffiths, Crosbie).
 Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research on Ageing (MICRA)
 Situated in the UK’s first city-region to achieve WHO age-friendly status, MICRA is an information
 hub, linking academics from any discipline that promotes ageing research. UoA1’s researchers in
 skin ageing, multimorbidity, cancer, cardiovascular disease etc. interface with experts in
 architecture, economics, engineering, and sociology to develop novel holistic solutions for issues
 facing the elderly.
 Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (MIB)
 Contains over 40 science and engineering research groups that collaborate in pioneering
 research, advancing knowledge and uses of biotechnology. UoA1’s researchers guide strategic
 development of pharmaceuticals and advanced materials for clinical application.
 Henry Royce Institute (Royce Institute)
 The EPSRC-funded UK National Institute for Advanced Materials Research and Innovation is a
 partnership of seven Universities (Manchester, Cambridge, Imperial College, Liverpool, Leeds,
 Oxford, Sheffield), National Nuclear Laboratory, and UKAEA. It hubs from Manchester (Chief
 Scientist: Withers, Regius Professor of Materials [UoA12]). The Biomedical Materials theme, led
 from Manchester (Cartmell [UoA12]), gives our researchers unprecedented access to the most
 advanced ideas and technology and we bring clinical expertise into UK-wide materials sciences.
 Christabel Pankhurst Institute for Health Technology (Pankhurst Institute)
 Recently launched, the Pankhurst Institute, a £25m partnership between UoM, MFT, HInM,
 business, and local government, promotes needs-led health technology innovation, spotlighting
 UoM’s rapidly expanding health technology portfolio. It is an important part of GM’s health
 innovation ecosystem, complementing MMPathIC, by optimising interactions between healthcare
 innovators, the public and commerce.
 Institute for Data Science and AI (IDSA)
 UoA1 researchers call on the expertise of IDSAI, which covers the complete data science life-
 cycle from information management, through analytics, to practical applications, joining
 methodologists with translational scientists, identifying practical applications of data science. This
 creates a distinctive virtuous circle, where challenging real-life problems drive methodology
 research, whilst providing a clinical route to exploiting new algorithms and methods.
 IDSAI, is only part of the digital ecosystem in Manchester, with expertise embedded in NHS and
 industry partners. UoM’s Digital Futures Platform pulls together these communities to build
 critical mass in new and emerging research areas. We are integrated into the “Health and Care”
 research arm, identifying clinical value and scope from co-ordinated approaches to unifying and
 widening access to digital technology.
 Institute for Health Policy and Organisation (IHPO)
 IHPO researches novel approaches to funding and delivering eﬀective health care, nationally and
 internationally, breaking paradigms (central planning, hospital-centred care, market-oriented
 reform) and championing evidenced opportunities (technological advance, devolved decision
 making). Our research contributes through: exploration of patient perspectives (Snow’s

                                                                                               Page 41

 NHS@70/Voices of Covid research); use of technology to update patient management
 (MMPathIC’s value proposition-driven biomarkers), and new approaches to disease prevention
 (Howell: Breast cancer prophylaxis Lancet.2019:REF2ID:158351714), earlier diagnosis/rule-out
 (P.Crosbie: community-based cancer screening, Thorax.2018:REF2ID:84588550; Body: ACS
 rule-out Ann.Int.Med.2017:REF2ID:64544379), and novel interventions (E.Crosbie bariatric
 surgery lessening uterine cancer risk, Int.J.Cancer.2019:REF2ID:82680279).
 Policy@Manchester
 UoM’s sector-leading policy engagement institute, connects researchers with policy makers and
 influencers, nurtures long-term policy engagement relationships, and enhances stakeholder
 understanding of pressing policy challenges.
 A recent success from UoA1’s involvement with Policy@Manchester is NICE guidance DG42,
 “Testing strategies for Lynch syndrome in people with endometrial cancer”. Published in 2020 it
 uses our research demonstrating links between Lynch syndrome and uterine cancer (E.Crosbie,
 Canc.Prevent.Res.2016;REF2ID:50562356). In 2018, Policy@Manchester partnered with
 cancer charity The Eve Appeal, raising awareness of Lynch syndrome and cancer screening
 practices through #LetsTalkLynch Campaign, which, through short videos outlined and
 explained our research, profiling real stories of women and families affected by Lynch-related
 cancer.

 4.2. Engagement with GM’s Healthcare Systems
 GMHSCP has unified healthcare delivery and patient records GM-wide, giving us unprecedented
 access to patients and patient data. This is a symbiosis, our research changing health across our
 city-region which, within England, has: highest premature CVS deaths; second highest cancer
 rates and infant mortality, and where deaths from lung disease, and the prevalence of arthritis,
 back pain and hip fractures are above the national average.
 Our research maps onto GM’s areas of population multi-morbidity, but impact reaches further,
 being directly transferable to deprived conurbations and communities world-wide.
 Through co-ordinated healthcare and the overarching role of HInM in clinical research: we have
 seen: a stepped increase in patient recruitment to NIHR Clinical Trials (31,927 in 2017/8 to 66,727
 in 2018/9): targeted innovations undergo effective, streamlined evaluation processes, enabling
 adoption at pace and scale across GM (e.g. Polynerve, T-MACs algorithm, and ABC care bundles)
 and drives innovative approaches to accessing and helping patients e.g. improving lives of
 Crohn’s and colitis patients: MY-IBD portal (McLaughlin); and Psoriasis Shout Out (Cordingley).
 HInM also facilitates collaborations that enhance research effectiveness across UoM and NHS
 Trusts, through progressive alignment of research offices, a common approach to costing and
 grant peer review, access to infrastructure, and unified researcher training; with the goal of
 completely seamless research infrastructures across MAHSC partners by 2030, optimising future
 clinical research access and scope.

 4.3 Patient and Carer Involvement
 Involvement of patients, the public and carers in decision making permeates our clinical research.
 Through interactions with patient societies, patient experts and patient focus groups. Examples of
 our interactions with the wider public as sources of research information and as participators in
 outputs are highlighted by the “Voice of NHS” series (MedHum), and participation in collaborative
 grants in 4.6.2,. Our partners websites detail how they work with patients and carers to bring added
 value to our joint activities: BRC; MAHSC partners; HInM; GMHSCP; ARC-GM. Of particular note
 is “Vocal” a joint UoM, MFT not for profit organisation that bring together people from all walks of
 life, and connects them with health research.

 4.4. Improving Healthcare and Economies through Industry Collaborations
 UoM’s Business Engagement & Knowledge Exchange team, Masood Enterprise Centre;
 Innovation Factory, Manchester Institute of Innovation Research and direct involvement with
 industry, ensure we can access entrepreneurial advice and industry introductions. UoA1’s
 established industry partnerships are at three levels.

                                                                                             Page 43
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 4.4.1 Strategic research agreements
 As an example, in 2018, because of UoA1’s genetics research, GM’s Genetic Campus, the
 NHS/NIHR clinical and diagnostic facilities in MFT, and the physical infrastructure offered through
 MSP, Qiagen (international gene-based diagnostics company), formed a partnership with UoM,
 MFT, MSP, HInM and Manchester City Council to create a Global Genomics Campus in
 Manchester, for innovation, life sciences, translational science and molecular diagnostics. The
 partnership’s vision brings together the city-region’s entire spectrum of public, academic and
 clinical resources to develop world-leading genomics in the heart of the Oxford Road Health and
 Life Sciences Corridor.
 In 2019 the partnership funded (£25m) and launched APIS Assay Technologies, sited on the
 Genomics Campus in Citylabs1.0. Through the partnership, APIS is driving commercialisation of
 innovative molecular diagnostics assisted by MMPathIC.
 In 2020, completion of the physical co-location of the partners took place with Qiagen re-siting
 ~300 staff into MSP’s new Citylabs2.0, on the MFT site. This is now Qiagen’s purpose-built single-
 site European Centre of Excellence for Precision Medicine and hub for diagnostics development.
 Other examples include:
  AstraZeneca: works closely with Cancer on ongoing programmes of anticancer drug
  discovery/evaluation and biomarker discovery (2016: £11m investment in Manchester Centre for
  Biomarker Sciences [Dive]).
  Walgreens-Boots-Alliance, long-standing partners in dermatological research with CfDR (2018
  £4m refunding), recently invested £1.7m to launch the Manchester Skin Proteome Study.
  GlaxoSmithKline, a partner with UoM and AstraZeneca in forming MCCIR. In 2017, GSK
  invested a further £2m in MCCIR as a pre-competitive industrial collaborator.
 4.4.2 Industry support for individual projects, mainly through funding discovery and trials of
 diagnostics, technologies and therapeutics has generated ~£60m of funding for UoA1 during
 REF2021.
 4.4.3 Memoranda of Understanding with industry partners characterise most of our major
 research initiatives. E.g: BRC (38 strategic and 37 SME industry partners), and MRC Stratified
 Medicine Initiatives (PSORT, MATURA and MASTERPLANS with 10, 9 and 9 industry partners
 respectively).

 4.5 Entrepreneurship

 4.7. Economic impact of our research
 Local government has developed an infrastructure that facilitates intellectual and economic
 growth in GM, and UoM has transformed its organisation to allow academics to contribute.
 Within this environment, from during REF2021 UoA1 increased grant income by £193m. This
 represents an increase in grant income/FTE/year of 19% which, through direct research and
 indirect service posts, contributing to the employment growth in the ORC by 11% from 2015 to
 2019.
 Through entrepreneurship and our translational pipelines, new start-ups (e.g UoA1 spin-outs
 [4.5]; APIS), relocation of major companies (e.g. Qiagen), and growth of existing SMEs (e.g.
 Chromition) has been enabled by UoA1 academics, contributing to the 61% business growth in
 ORC from 2012-2018.
 At a wider geographical level we have assisted job creation and economic growth (e.g. Our:
 REF3 Impact Cases record that research as stimulating >250 new UK industry posts, and
 >£900m/year increased revenue for UK/international businesses; grants such as UKRI Global
 Challenges Research Fund directly support new posts in overseas health research). We work
 with UK and international companies to give added value to their products, which brought £60m
 into GM during REF2021. Internationalisation of our IP also generates overseas income for UoM
 (e.g £62m agreement with AVROBIO).

 4.8 Contribution to Medical Science and Wider Society.

 4.9. Social Responsibility through Education and Clinical Impact
 Social Responsibility is one of UoM’s three Core Goals, sitting equally alongside world-class
 research and outstanding learning and student experience. UoM is signatory to the National Co-
 ordinating Centre for Public Engagement’s Manifesto for Public Engagement, and in 2018 was
 awarded a Gold Engage Watermark.

                                                                                          Page 48

 Opportunities offered by our local clinical research environment, focus UoA1’s research strategy
 at problems endemic in our local community. By addressing local healthcare needs our research
 is also directly pertinent to other UK and wider global communities.
 UoA1 researchers engage with our public both in the form of specialist patient groups (e.g.
 partners in PSORT), and public engagement activities. During REF2021, 179 shared our
 research with the community from children to members of public-facing learned societies, public
 lectures, local and national Science Weeks etc.
