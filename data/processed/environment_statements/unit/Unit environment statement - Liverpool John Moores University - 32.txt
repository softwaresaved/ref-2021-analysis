 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy
 Summary
 Liverpool School of Art and Design (LSAD), is approaching its 200th anniversary from origins
 established in 1825 as Liverpool Mechanic’s College of Arts (LMCA), known for its enlightened
 attitude to equality in education and access to learning in its provision of creative
 experimentation and social application within a transdisciplinary context. Some 190 years later,
 we reviewed our research structures and processes following REF2014 and purposely founded
 ART LABS (Artistic Research & Technologies Labs) Research Centre in 2015 as a conscious
 descendent of these attributes and to give a flexible structure within which to develop our
 recognised research strengths and presentation to the world. Our strong impact commitment
 echoes the ‘civic university’ aim of the University Strategic Plan and supports the Faculty
 mission: ‘To support the creation and dissemination of new knowledge from rigorous research,
 ethically conducted, by diverse scholars committed to making a positive difference to diverse
 communities’. In 2019, the University recognised ART LABS had realised the aims of our
 REF2014 research strategy and was, “already operating at a level commensurate with
 institutional requirements of a Research Institute” [minutes of LJMU Executive Leadership Team
 (19.107)] and approved ART LABS becoming the Institute of Art & Technology (IAT), underlining
 the growing importance and centrality of professional research, art practice and advanced study
 in our provision.

 Context & Structure
 IAT is a dynamic research unit within RIBA award-winning John Lennon Art & Design Building
 (JLADB) at the heart of Liverpool’s Knowledge Quarter, underpinning and contributing to the
 acclaimed cultural ecology. Our reputation for HEI and cultural sector collaboration with key city
 cultural organisations, significantly Tate Liverpool (TL), Foundation for Art and Creative
 Technologies (FACT) and Liverpool Biennial (LB), was recognised in REF2014.
 Within ART LABS, the Exhibition Research Centre, (first UK academic research centre devoted
 to exhibition study, 2012), was reimagined as Exhibition Research Lab (ERL - led by Krysa).
 Alongside the Contemporary Art Lab (CAL - led by Fallows), ERL developed recognised
 research strengths of REF2014. ERL sustained the LB and TL partnerships through 3
 embedded (50:50) researchers (Birchall, Krysa Wright, M) and originated a further (Leaper)
 with John Moores Painting Prize (JMPP). ERL acts as LSAD’s public facing contemporary art
 venue delivering a year-round, international, research-led programme of exhibitions and events
 (ICS3). FACTLab was devised (2015) as a 3-month pilot sponsored by the Culture Programme
 of the EU and ‘Connecting Cities’ to host visiting artists and support the development of new
 works/workshops/skill-sharing (ICS3). FACTLab further developed into the interdisciplinary
 Experimental Technologies Lab (ETL ), still in partnership with FACT, but now with additional
 collaboration (KPI10, p3) from LJMU’s Screen School (LSS), Computing, Built Environment and
 Astrophysics Research Institute (ARI). ETL (led by Wright, M and Woodbridge from LSS)
 enjoys the use of our new X-Gallery and Liverpool Fab Lab refurbishment (2019 - p12) within
 JLADB and pioneers research in the fields of immersive arts, creative technology, and art-
 science interaction (section 3 - income/resources; section 4 - collaboration). These partnerships
 have realised great impact (ICS3). ART LABS also included Face Lab (led by Wilkinson, C,
 appointed LSAD Director, 2015), based upon established research in faces and identity (ICS2).
 We have been the only UK academic partner in an EU-funded project (2013-2018) with the
 European museum confederation, L’Internationale (section 4; ICS1), establishing the ‘Uses of

                                                                                              Page 1

 Art’ research strand (led by Byrne). ART LABS Director (Hyatt, appointed 2016) extended the
 ‘regeneration through culture’ research strand, and we created a new embedded post with RIBA
 North Gallery (2015-18; Perysinaki; Walsh), leading to the fifth and final lab addition in 2018,
 City Lab (led by Byrne). This encompassed the ‘Artists’ City’ and ‘Uses of Art’ research strands
 from the last REF, along with a new architectural design research strand (Hudson; Hatton,
 MacDonald, Perysinaki; Tucker; Wilkinson, D), realising the aim to create a centre for cross-
 faculty interdisciplinary research, and clarifying our influence in relation to co-design practice
 across Liverpool and beyond (ICS1). ART LABS acknowledged and consolidated REF2014-
 recognised international quality (80% 3*: “The sub-panel judged the research environment to be
 both vital and sustainable and able to support research of internationally and nationally excellent
 quality”) built around the research activity of key academics with collaborative links across the
 city and beyond, eventually leading to research institute status as IAT in 2019.
 IAT is managed by a Steering Committee (Director and 5 lab leaders), who respond to an
 external Advisory Board (Honorary Professors and Partner Representatives), collaborating
 schools and the University Research and Knowledge Exchange Committee (URKEC). Full
 membership of IAT is based on Significant Responsibility for Independent Research (SRIR)
 status, but IAT accepts all interested researchers as associate members, to create an inclusive,
 diverse and supported research community.
 IAT grew a thriving PGR community (section 2, p8) integrated into all 5 Labs and with a
 dedicated communal studio. All research feeds into the school teaching and learning
 environment, including lab presentations to all postgraduate students in the cross-school
 research methodologies module, visiting fellow talks/seminars/workshops (section 2, p8),
 student visits to international research partners [e.g., Shanghai University of Engineering
 Science (SUES), 2019] and undergraduate contributions to Fabric District (FD) festivals (p14). A
 pop-up Learning Lab meets when required for discussions at the interface linking research and
 teaching, with contributions from key pedagogic researchers (Smith, C).

 Impact Strategy
 IAT disseminates research power for the social good, building on a strategy noted REF2014 as,
 “an approach that was conducive to achieving impacts of very considerable reach and
 significance, particularly through emphasis on public engagement with the local community as a
 route to impact.” Links to the processes, institutions and communities of our city remain
 important pillars (section 2: people and EDI; section 4: local festivals and public health activities;
 ICS3). IAT has fulfilled the REF2014 impact strategy in the following ways:
       Advice/consultancy


                                                                                                 Page 3
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
     REF2014 researchers advised and assisted a range of arts organisations and art
     professionals. We have widened this to include international advice and consultancy in
     relation to public health and wellbeing, heritage, justice, humanitarian processes,
     architectural design and urban development (ICS1-3). We have developed research
     projects and disseminated good practice (networking events), the organisation of research
     events (table 3) and staff mentoring (p7). We promoted a research culture embedded in
     collaboration with international partners in the fields of art and design (e.g., LB, TL, FACT,
     Transmediale, Aarhus University, École Nationale Supérieure de Architecture de Paris-La
     Villette, Central St Martins College of Art), and provided influence through our ability to
     relate to other academic fields and engage with issues of global interest and significance.
     Our research was therefore targeted to address cultural enrichment (ICS2: Face Lab
     heritage projects; section 4: LB2014-2018; ICS3; City Lab’s FX Verlarde project), enhance
     social welfare (section 4: Face Lab’s humanitarian projects; Design for Dementia; Arts Loco;
     Narratives of Homelessness), stimulate urban regeneration (section 4: Fabric District Art
     Festivals; ‘Creative zones to revitalise the economy’), deliver highly skilled people (Face
     Lab trained approx. 50 security/forensic professionals worldwide from 4 continents; ICS2)
     and influence international policy (ICS1; ICS2). IAT has provided 127 invited UK and 70
     world-wide lectures/keynotes; reviewers for 38 journals, 10 funding bodies, 4 conference
     panels, 5 prize/award panels and 9 universities, and editors for 15 journals; 5 TV
     appearances as experts, 10 radio shows, 4 televised forensic cases and hundreds of news
     articles (ICS2); consultancy for approx. 20 international humanitarian/forensic cases; 8
     university research affiliations; and 15 national and 10 international professional and policy-
     making contributions (table 2). Face Lab was invited to the GREAT Festival 2018 in Hong
     Kong by the Department of International Trade to promote British technological innovation
     (ICS2). UK Music organised a special 2016 All-Party Parliamentary Group on Music event
     at the British Library with guided tour of the ‘Punk 1976-78’ exhibition (Fallows) and Q&A
     for the twelve attending MPs and parliamentarians. MacDonald (2015) collaborated with
     local architects, Halsall Lloyd Practice, to establish new architectural standards for the
     design of an environment to assist people to live better with dementia, informing the
     construction of the Building Research Establishment’s Dementia Dwelling 2018 (Watford),
     opened by Lord Best, Co-Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Housing & Care for
     Older People, and received positive feedback from both end-users and GPs. In recognition,
     MacDonald was awarded the 2019 International Design in Mental Health Network Award.
     IAT has provided further academic architectural contributions in relation to sustainable
     design and urban housing (Perysinaki), informal spaces (Hudson) and Building
     Performance Simulation (Tucker). The Metropolitan Cathedral have reviewed their
     permanent exhibition within the Crypt as a consequence of the HLF-supported (Wilkinson,
     D), and HLF have used the catalogue to demonstrate best practice in disseminating HL-
     funded research.

      Public engagement
     IAT provides an outward facing profile for art and design research and serves to articulate
     the value of cultural activity within an urban context. REF2014, LSAD researchers achieved
     impact by curating public exhibitions to enhance the understanding of visual arts. We have
     widened the impact to include art-science interactions through events, performances and
     museum artefacts, as well as continued curation of public exhibitions (ICS1-3).
     The RIBA validation panel (2017) commended the school on “its continuing engagement
     with the city region through strong links to its cultural institutions.” Our close partnership with
     the world-renowned LB led to ERL-hosted artists, events and exhibitions in 2014, 2016,


                                                                                                 Page 4
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
     2018 (Krysa; ICS3) and ‘Bloomberg New Contemporaries’ 2018. The Liverpool
     Metropolitan Cathedral exhibition (Wilkinson, D) was viewed by in excess of 125,000
     people from 70 countries and was supported by a series of public lectures. In 2017, LSAD
     was approved as the Liverpool LASER host (Roughley; Wilkinson, C); one of only 37
     worldwide hosts sponsored by Leonardo, the International Society for Art, Sciences and
     Technology, as part of an international programme of art-science events, providing 6 open-
     access videocasts of public events at JLADB, TL, FACT, Bluecoat and Walker Art Gallery.
     Face Lab researchers (Roughley; Shrimpton; Liu, Wilkinson, C) have also appeared as
     experts in 4 television documentaries (2019 BBC4 ‘Digging for Britain’; 2017 C5 ‘Ancient
     Mysteries: Shrunken Heads’; 2016 BBC ALBA ‘Cean an Righ/The King's Head’; 2016 C4
     ‘Secret Histories: Shakespeare's Tomb’) and 4 forensic cases featured on ‘Crimewatch UK’
     and ‘Dutch Crime College’ (ICS2). LSAD (MacKinnon-Day) produced a pop-up exhibition,
     2016, as a series of Sci-Art works developed with scientists from Liverpool School of
     Tropical Medicine and Artist Teacher Associates during student visits to laboratories and
     archives. We have therefore pioneered in-vivo practice-led research with leading institutions
     and partners, with research that is inherently interdisciplinary and outward facing (ICS3;
     section 4 Tate Exchange, Luminary Lecture Series and forensic investigation).
     Researchers have developed international profiles. Williams was named as one of the ‘Five
     Artists to Follow on Instagram’ (The New York Times, 2020) and has featured in 11 articles
     on British Art in The Guardian since 2015 and in a BBC documentary ‘The Story of Welsh
     Art’. In 2020, following on from his acclaimed 2016 ‘The Gulch’ solo exhibition at the
     Barbican and his 2018 collection-focused artwork for the Royal Albert Memorial Museum,
     Williams was chosen to lead the Science Museum National Collections Centre’s art project.
     In 2018, Stidworthy was awarded a special prize by the David and Yuko Juda Art
     Foundation in recognition of her high-profile shows at Sao Paulo Biennial (2014), British Art
     Show 8 (2015), Hayward Touring exhibition (2015) and Wellcome Collection (2016). SMP
     Emma Harper lodged a 2018 Scottish Parliament motion to congratulate the Face Lab team
     on the ‘4D portrait of Robert Burns’ exhibited at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery and
     the Face Lab depictions of Robert the Bruce and Robert Burns have featured in over 1
     million online articles worldwide. Krysa co-curated international biennials, reaching
     audiences of 1.2M (LB2016; Sapporo International Art Triennale 2020) with extensive
     media coverage (e.g., Frieze, Mousse, Guardian, BBC). ‘Punk 1976-78’ (Fallows) attracted
     an audience of 335,891 (117,531 London, 9,360 Sunderland, 209,000 Liverpool) and
     generated over 96 national/international press articles/reviews together with television and
     radio coverage. ‘Sex Pistols – April 1976: The Art of PTMADDEN’ featured in The Guardian
     by Jon Savage (Apr16) and Wallpaper* magazine by Brian Dillon (May16).

        Development of Liverpool as an artists’ city
     REF2014 articulated Liverpool as a good place for artists to live and work as a key driver.
     To further augment our civic impact and support the growth of creative and digital
     industries, we created 2 new embedded posts (JMPP and RIBA North Gallery) and a
     partnership (MoU 2020) with Baltic Creative CIC (Armstrong-Gibbs, Board Chair). IAT
     provided numerous skills workshops, open labs, and entrepreneurship training (Fab Lab
     pop-ups; Hack nights; Show and Tell gatherings; Makefests) for graduate and early career
     creatives hosted at our cultural partners. TL, FACT and LB provided 6 internships and
     offered mentoring prizes every year to graduates. LSAD provided graduate poly-residencies
     at Liverpool artist-led studios (METAL; CBS; Royal Standard; Bridewell). Graduates have
     become lead artists/directors in these organisations. These partnerships further realised



                                                                                            Page 5
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
     REF2014 strategic strand, ‘Artists’ City’, to support creative art graduates to stay and
     prosper in Liverpool.
     IAT has also been responsible for changes to the cultural landscape, through the support of
     emerging talent and the involvement of internationally regarded creatives alongside
     Liverpool-based creatives, including (ICS3) Sony Award-winning broadcaster/writer/art
     historian, Tim Marlow, who provided a private masterclass 2015 for 15 shortlisted art
     writers; the month-long LSAD residencies for the 5 winners of the JMPP China every
     LB2014-2018; FACTLab Brazilian artists-in-residence 2015-17; and 3 JMPP and Biennial
     Fellows 2018. IAT has inspired the public to engage with art/artists through discussion
     events (e.g., LB discursive talks at ERL) and participatory events (e.g., ‘OK - The Musical’
     at Tate; ‘Cloudmaker’ at FACT) and enhanced capacities for art organizations to engage
     new audiences in new ways (e.g., FACT-LB2016 online gaming platform Minecraft
     exhibition - additional 4,876 engagement visits, 526 unique new visitors).

 2. People
 Staffing strategy
 IAT supports current staff at all research levels through the promotions process whilst recruiting
 research active staff to fill vacant posts. Over the next 5 years, we aim to secure promotion for
 20% senior lecturers or readers and recruit diverse research active staff to our team. All newly
 recruited permanent staff who are new to HE teaching/research are supported through a role
 development top-up of 120 hours p.a. research workload allocation.
 Following a deliberate research growth strategy, our research staffing base has increased
 significantly to 33 people or 27.1FTE (REF2014: 11 people/8.6FTE). 60% academic staff are
 research active, surpassing the faculty target of 55% with considerable upward trajectory
 alongside significant staff development. An additional 17% (8 staff) are currently undertaking
 PhD research (6 internal; 2 external). 5 staff successfully completed part-time PhDs (1 PhD by
 practice), and 2 staff achieved independent researcher status from research support posts (Liu;
 Roughley). One of the HEI-Arts embedded posts (RIBA North Gallery - Perysinaki) was
 promoted to Senior Lecturer and another was promoted to Head of Art and Design (LB - Krysa).
 5 new starter ECRs developed into mid-career researchers and we successfully promoted to 1
 Professor, 1 Associate Dean Research, 3 Readers and 2 Heads of Subject. IAT also attracted a
 4-month sabbatical in 2017 (Krysa) from the Faculty peer-reviewed sabbatical scheme. We
 submit 13% early career researchers (ECRs), 46% mid-career researchers and 41% established
 researchers (profs/readers).
 Key people within Liverpool’s arts organisations have been recognised as Honorary Professors:
 Artistic Directors at TL (Francesco Manacorda, 2017), FACT (Mike Stubbs, 2014-2019) and
 Bluecoat (Bryan Biggs, 2014-2021), and Director of Surgical Art (Partha Vaiude, 2018).
 Honorary Professors contribute to the research environment through joint research/public
 engagement events (2017 ‘Malcolm Lowry’ conference and 2017 ‘Captain Beefheart Weekend’,
 Bluecoat; 2018 CERN LASER event at FACT; 2018 LightNight Surgical Art; FD Festivals 2018
 and 19; 2015 ‘Artists’ City Writers Workshop’ at Tate); lecture series (Luminary Lectures, LASER
 talks); and as members of IAT Advisory Board. LJMU conferred honorary fellowships to
 architect, Daniel Libeskind (2018) and local sculptor, Emma Rodgers (2016), and these high-
 profile creatives contribute to the research environment through public lectures, creative
 projects, maker workshops and student tours.
 Each researcher can request school scholarship development funding (budget £20,000 p.a.) and
 apply for biannual Faculty peer reviewed QR funding (2015-20 total £431,404). We secured
 £111,200 Faculty QR funds, supporting 53 projects for 8 ECR and 16 established researchers
 and £8,200 GCRF-2018 funds (Wright) for the ‘CoDICE’ project, Indonesia. Researchers have

                                                                                                Page 6

 been recognised by the university through financial prizes; such as the VC’s Award for
 Excellence in Social and Economic Engagement and Knowledge Transfer (2016 Face Lab; 2018
 Roughley), Spotlight Award for Research (Roughley 2016 Runner Up; Wright, M 2016 Runner
 Up) and Scholarly Snaps Awards (McAssey 2017 Highly Commended).
 Senior research staff (Fallows, Hyatt, Krysa, Wilkinson, C) operate an open-door mentoring
 policy (since 2015) and LSAD staff have attended 69 ACTivator workshops (5 ECRs attended 17
 workshops), with the most popular workshops being, ‘The Building Blocks of Impact’, ‘Funding
 Applications: Getting a Yes’ and ‘Surveying Your Funding Landscape’. The Faculty also provides
 research/enterprise drop-in sessions every month relating to bid development. Between 2016
 and 2019, LSAD staff increased research applications by 228% and research income by 190%.
 Our creatives have been recognised externally through prizes/medals for their practice and
 research (table 1).

 We hold regular meetings for full and associate members of the research institute to promote
 inter-lab communication, research development and best practice. These include interactive
 seminars, iterative workshops, writing for practice-based research, and lab thematic

                                                                                                Page 7

 development, whilst annual research institute event, Inter-Labs, ensures the promotion of cross–
 institute communication. This inspired cross-disciplinary funding applications in relation to
 drones, evolutionary anthropology, urban regeneration, immersive experiences, smart cities and
 STEAM education (with Science, FET, LSS, Education) with 2 grants awarded (UKRI/AHRC
 2020-22 for immersive experiences; AHRC Newton China Fund 2018 for urban regeneration).
 The Doctoral Academy provides research supervisor training to all new research active
 appointments, who then become mentored co-supervisors. In REF2014 we aimed for 40%
 academic staff to be qualified research supervisors and we have reached 38%.
 Our research-intensive staff are high-level academic leaders who contribute to key strategic
 decisions in relation to University/Faculty/School research policies, protocols, and funding
 mechanisms (table 2). This activity has enabled career progression with research intensive staff
 recruited to senior strategic roles within the university research community, including the Faculty
 Associate Dean for Research and Knowledge Exchange (Sheldon 2014–2017, Hyatt 2017-
 2021), Faculty Associate Dean for Global Engagement (Roberts 2019-2023) and the Dean of
 the University’s new Doctoral Academy 2018. (Sheldon).
 We have invested in artist fellowships/residencies and the fixed term Virtuoso post to attract
 international award-winning creatives to work and collaborate in Liverpool and deliver teaching,
 research collaboration, public engagement, exhibitions, a book publication, public lectures,
 events, and student teaching. These have included two members of Assemble (Turner Prize
 Winners 2016) who shared 0.2FTE Virtuoso post; JMPP in China winners’ residencies (15 total
 2014, 2016, 2018 - 2020 postponed); JMPP winner 2018 3-month residency (Jacqui Hallum);
 Bloomberg New Contemporaries 2018 residency (Rosa Johan Uddoh) over 2019-2020; and 29
 other IAT international visiting researchers.

 Research Students
 Enrolled research student numbers have increased significantly. We currently have 37
 MPhil/PhD research students registered (20 full-time; 17 part-time). We supervised 13 (10FTE)
 PhD students (REF2014: 7 completions; 9.5 FTE enrolments) and 31 MRes to successful
 completion. 3 planned doctoral completions were delayed due to CoVid19 until the end of
 2020/early 2021 (Smith, K, 2020; Smith, R, 2020; Schofield, 2021). To facilitate and stimulate
 further national/international expansion in this area, we established a formal 5-year agreement
 with Transart Institute, NY (June 2020), to collaborate in the delivery of the international PGR
 Programme in Creative Practice (10 students per year): 11 LJMU researchers (7 from LSAD) are
 supervisors alongside 11 external supervisors from Australia, USA, UK, and Europe. IAT
 researchers (Heathcote; Roberts) are PhD supervisors for academics from our Chinese partner
 universities.
 Each PGR has a supervisory team made up of 2/3 supervisors from our growing qualified team
 to monitor and support progress. Professors (Fallows, Hyatt, Krysa, Wilkinson, C) have
 significant experience (collectively 69 PhD completions; 65 MRes/MPhil completions).
 Researchers have examined 14 external UK and 2 international PhD theses, collaborated with
 14 external co-supervisors and been part of 3 cross-faculty and 6 cross-school supervisory
 teams. We have adopted the LJMU eDoc system fully, enabling the remote access and virtual
 vivas during CoVid-19. All PGRs have received a 25% reduction in fees plus paid extensions to
 those adversely affected.
 PGR has been financially supported by 16 competitive LJMU VC Scholarships (14 full, 1 faculty
 match and 1 fees only; as compared to zero in REF2014); by School fee waivers (£77,033.26);
 and 1 cross-faculty studentship. On average, £170,000 has been spent annually by the
 university on our PhD studentships/bursaries (approx. £1M total). The Doctoral Academy has


                                                                                              Page 8
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 supported 8 PGRs with travel and conference bursaries (up to £175 UK, £350 international and
 £200 virtual from 2020) and 2 PGRs with international mobility awards (£1,000) to undertake
 personal development in Japan (2018) and USA (2018). The Faculty Research Degrees
 Committee disburses PGR financial assistance, including up to £50,000 p.a. for teaching
 experience, research-based travel, and conference attendance. 12 PGRs studied the LJMU 3is
 Teacher Training programme as part of their career development, leading to teaching
 opportunities during their research period. 1 PGR received formal training through the LJMU
 PGCert in Higher Education. The school also supported 13 PGRs through £2,000 Susan Cotton
 Travel Awards for international research visits to Japan and San Francisco (3 in REF2014).
 PGRs were externally funded by scholarship/awards from DSTL, RIBA, Japan Foundation
 Endowment and Merseycare NHS Trust. Our PGRs received 6 LJMU prizes for best poster
 presentation (2015), best short research film (2016), 2 community contribution recognitions
 (2019) and 2 outstanding communicator awards (2020) at the Annual University Research Day.
 Our PGR environment includes opportunities to participate in practical activity (e.g., curatorial)
 with professionals in the field and contribute to academic dialogue where art and design are
 explored and debated. Our PhD provision recognises collaboration with external organisations
 as a method of combining practice and theory within the PGR experience. We have long-
 established exchanges and co-supervision with our partners and local organisations, including
 TL, Bluecoat, LB and Open Eye. LSAD ensures that partners offer PGR opportunities for
 research training and development: training in the protocols of archive and collection
 management, selection for galleries, writing, publicity, events, audience development and
 engagement.
 In the Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES) 2019, LSAD was ranked in the
 highest quartile globally for resources (83%), research skills (91%), and professional
 development (84%), with high satisfaction rates for understanding research integrity (93%),
 critical analysis skills (93%) and specialist resources (85%). The annual, student-led, SoFA
 (School of Art) Talks programme has proved a fruitful forum for academic sharing, and in 2020, it
 was developed into a two-day, PGR-led symposium hosted at TL. The student-led Architecture
 Society is supported by LSAD (£2000 p.a.) and organises a guest lecture series (approx. 6
 events p.a.). 3 staff and 7 PGRs contributed to the Institutional Research Café events (held 4
 times each semester), enabling interdisciplinary dialogue, networking and increasing visibility of
 research amongst staff and students. The 2018 cross-disciplinary ‘Smart Sportswear Using
 Sensor Technology’ hub at SUES led to a joint LSAD-SUES art exhibition in China and UK,
 2019, and an International Postgraduate Academic Forum on Textile and Garment Innovation at
 SUES, 2019 (keynotes - Ibi and Owen, K).
 We provide creative art opportunities for PGRs through research, practice, and knowledge
 transfer activity to enhance graduate prospects and professional development. Hyatt curated an
 event series (‘Rock Art’ 2017) at HOME Manchester, that included PGR performances and
 contributions. Wilkinson (C) mentors all Face Lab PGRs in forensic/archaeological casework to
 fulfil Royal Anthropological Institute certification requirements. LSAD offers curatorial experience
 to enable PGRs to programme the Atrium Gallery in JLADB and supports student-led events
 (e.g., ‘CoLab’ - cross-lab pop-up). Krysa instigated a partnership with Aarhus University (MOU
 2016) for PGR collaboration, exchange and supervision, and organised 2 international doctoral
 research symposia: ‘Excessive Research’ at LSAD and Transmediale Festival, Berlin (2015),
 and ‘Contemporary Research Intensive’ at University of Venice and University of the Arts
 Helsinki’s Research Pavilion, Venice Biennale (2017). Wilkinson (C) organised a Face Lab
 PGR/PDRA research symposium with University of Amsterdam’s RaceFaceID group (where she




                                                                                               Page 9

 was visiting fellow) leading to a visiting PGR in Face Lab (2016). Face Lab also hosted visiting
 PGRs from Universities of Sao Paulo, Granada and Bern.

 Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity (EDI)
 We submit 13% early career (7% of outputs), 46% mid-career (51% of outputs) and 41%
 established researchers (40% of outputs). ECRs received 25% UoA QR funding, and 60% male,
 36% female and 3% nonbinary researchers provide 58%, 40% and 4% outputs respectively.
 IAT supports LJMU’s 5-year EDI strategy through visible role models, staff mentoring/support,
 EDI awareness events, strategic outreach and contribution to university policymaking.
 Visible role models include the school management team, which is made up of 50% men and
 50% women; including 2 female professors, 2 male professors, one male reader, one BAME
 academic and two female academic support managers. We have one female BAME Professor.
 Since 2014, the Luminary Lecture Series hosted high profile female and BAME creatives: 15
 women (56%) and 10 BAME creatives (37%).
 Contribution to university EDI policymaking, procedure and structure includes Director of School
 (Wilkinson, C) as the EDI Faculty lead, Chair of the LJMU Women Professors Network 2017-
 19, member of the Faculty (also Hyatt) and University Professors and Readers Conferment
 Panel since 2016, and external on the ARI EDI panel.
 IAT provides formal (Aurora Leadership Programme) and informal mentoring for a number of
 female academics across the university (Krysa; Wilkinson, C). Female researchers have been
 mentored through career progression with one successful PhD by Practice, one promotion to
 Reader and one promotion to Professor. Three female researchers are currently registered and
 supported in part-time PhD research (75% of supported staff PhDs). Female staff have been
 trained through the Stonewall LGBT+ Leadership Programme, Aurora Leadership Programme
 and Lean Six Sigma Yellow and Black Belts with Knowledge Academy. Research active staff
 returning to work following maternity leave (4) and researchers with childcare responsibilities
 have been supported through flexible working and working from home opportunities. Academics
 with significant family illness have been provided with unlimited, unpaid, compassionate leave
 following sick leave entitlement and enabled to return to work with flexible working (one male;
 one female). Staff with disabilities are supported through LJMU People and Organisational
 Development (provision of laptops and/or dongles; skills training; technical assistant support).
 EDI awareness events include a Care Leavers in HE event, 2016, with guest poets, Lemn
 Sissay and Louise Wallwein, and a ‘Trans Hate Crime Symposium’, 2017, with Merseyside
 Police and Navajo Merseyside LGBTIQ (LJMU Partner). The 2018 Fabric District (FD) Festival,
 (p15), included an evening (‘I am not a number’) examining 50 years of Black fashion including
 Black fashion industry professionals (hosted by Ibi) and an exhibition by people with neurological
 disorders, partnered with the Brain Charity (Hyatt). In 2019, Birchall set up an LGBTQ+
 Research Hub with TL (ICS3) where Liverpool Pride produced a week of workshop activities,
 debate events, film and audience activism (6430 attendees). Pereda’s ‘Afrobits’, collaborating
 with Lancaster University, promoted understanding of the contribution of African cultures through
 the exploration of music, using Liverpool as the primary point that facilitated the slave trade.
 ‘Afrobits’ won Best Research Project Finalist and was Runner Up in the People's Choice Awards
 in the British Library Labs Awards 2020. Researchers and students have made contributions to
 Asia Triennial Manchester (Chuhan; Roberts), Windrush Festival 2019 (McNeil) and Black
 History Week 2019 (Pereda). MacDonald was awarded 2014 Roscoe Citizenship Award for
 Lifelong Services to Mental Health and 2019 Design in Mental Health Network Award for
 contribution to local mental health services. He is also trustee of the Peckham Pioneering Health
 Centre, Design Champion for MerseyCare NHS Trust and a member of the Performance and


                                                                                            Page 10

 Investment Committee. Arts Loco, arts for mental health organisation (McNeill), was set up to
 offer an innovative model of arts and health to enhance the wellbeing of communities through a
 placement in Aintree's hospital arts programme.
 The school has invested in a long-term outreach strategy with Dot Art Schools Awards Bursary
 to encourage artistic children into HE and the John Lennon Imagine Bursary to support young
 adults leaving care into university. We launched the Sorrell Foundation National Saturday Club
 for art and design in 2017 and have hosted STEAM school events, with Education and Screen
 Schools, to reach socio-economically challenged areas and promote artistic research, creative
 art research careers and art-science research collaborations.
 The school promotes a culture where staff and students feel safe to report acts of harassment,
 discrimination, hate or violence and are confident to seek support. LJMU Staff Survey 2019,
 showed LSAD was one of the most academically engaged (90%) and motivated (93%) schools,
 where staff felt treated with respect and fairness (80%), with line managers leading by example
 (91%). The school has 2 EDI champions, one academic and one support staff. Members of the
 School Management Team are involved in Fashion Academics Creating Equality (FACE- Ibi
 founding member) contributing to the Council for Higher Education in Art & Design (CHEAD),
 sitting on the British Fashion Council Diversity and Inclusivity steering committee and lobbying
 the Office for Students for EDI inclusion in the National Student Survey.

 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities
 Income
 Researchers have attracted prestigious external research funding from UK and international
 funding bodies: ACE, UKRI, BA, EU and National Geographic Society. A total of £1,229,763.48
 research/research service funding was awarded (REF2014: £587,885) with an additional
 £238,268.95 enterprise income (REF2014: zero) for consultancy and professional training
 (ICS2).
 In 2013, ACE awarded £60,000 for ‘Artists’ City’ project, realised in 2015, and ERL (Krysa) was
 awarded a total of £29,850 (2018-2019) to develop ERL’s artistic and public engagement
 programme and enhance understanding of the arts (ICS3). IAT received £50,000 EU-funding, as
 part of a E2.5 million European consortium (L’Internationale) research project, realised in 2018
 (ICS1). Between 2015 and 2020, Face Lab were awarded total £1,006,291.94 funding through

 2020 MA/PhD awards for ‘Museums, Big Data, and the Violence of Empire’ (Pereda, 2020-
 2024), both with Universities of Liverpool and Lancaster and National Museums, Liverpool.
 IAT artists (Carr; Evans; Fallows; Hyatt; MacKinnon-Day; Morris; Stidworthy; Wilkinson, C;
 Wilkinson, D; Williams) indirectly received significant external funding/commissions to support
 exhibitions, festivals and curatorial projects from charities, government organisations, museums,
 galleries and sponsors. In total, this amounts to over £1 million since 2014, and includes
 significant examples from Hong Gah Museum Taipei 2019, MOSTYN 2018 (£20,000), SALT


                                                                                           Page 11

 Infrastructure and Facilities
 LJMU invests in Face Lab space (6 staff; 2 PGRs) based at Liverpool Science Park IC1
 (888sq.ft; £21,000 p.a.) housing workstations, 3D/4D digital technology (scanners, haptic
 interfaces, printers) and traditional modelling materials. Recently, Face Lab received £26,000
 from 2020 RCIF funding and £39,165 from the World-Class Labs fund to update equipment and
 purchase new resources (high spec render system and holographic projector). LSAD provides a
 collaborative studio next to ERL for the embedded researchers and their PGRs (45m2) alongside
 in-house research spaces at the partner institutions.
 LJMU has made significant investment in research provision: a purposely designed public facing
 gallery (180m2), used by ERL for an international programme of exhibitions and public events
 (approx. 4-6 annually); a large dedicated space to accommodate the growth of PGRs numbers
 (203m2 compared to 83m2 in REF2014); Atrium Gallery (approx. 20m2) curated by PGRs; a
 Faculty drop-in PGR space hosting a suite of PC support; and libraries offering a range of
 dedicated study spaces, digital print resources and skills advice to support PGR studies.
 Fallows has created, with Library Services, the Special Collections and Archives, a resource
 infrastructure to house strategically acquired archives as research legacy, alongside expanded
 and digitised archive storage facilities (p16). Institutional funding (£105,000) has enabled the
 acquisition of important archives (Fallows) including: ‘Teenage: The Jon Savage Archive’
 (2015); ‘1966: The Jon Savage Archive’ (2018); ‘The Jamie Reid Archive’ (2018); ‘Street Style:
 The Ted Polhemus Archive’ (2018); ‘Behind the Scenes at the International Times: The Bill Levy
 Archive’ (2019), and a new section for planning of national/ international exhibitions [Punk 1976-
 78 (Fallows), Heartfield (Hyatt)]. Library and Archive Services receive a growing number of
 donated archives due to the international reputations of IAT researchers [‘Barney Bubbles: The
 Belinda Syme Archive’ (Fallows, 2020); ‘Rae Jeffs Archive’ (Hyatt, 2020)].
 The ‘Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral Architectural Design’ project (Wilkinson, D) was
 supported by HLF (£10,000) pulled together previously unrecorded material from multiple
 sources last seen together for 3 days in May 1960, including entries from up-and-coming
 architects of the new post 1945 generation (Denys Lasdun, Clive Entwistle, Hidalgo Moya,
 Archigram). Wilkinson (D) created a new archive in the exhibition catalogue mapping the
 conflict between modernisers and traditionalists within the Catholic church during the early
 1960’s as played out through the process of architecture.

                                                                                            Page 12
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 There has been a major workshop investment (3D fabrication; Construction; Digital Imaging; IT;
 Printing; Textiles) with the continued remit to support research priorities. In 2017, we appointed
 an Operational Manager (McNulty) to oversee the technical provision. The technical team won
 an LJMU Professional Service Excellence Prize for Leadership (McNulty), an LJMU Learning
 Excellence Award (Santos-Barea) and an LJMU Innovation Award (LSAD technical team) in
 2019. In 2018, the university made a capital investment of £483,266 to develop a new digital
 gallery (X-Gallery) and 3D digital studio (Fab Lab Liverpool), forming a base for ETL as it
 transitioned from FACTLab. These are open to interdisciplinary research (LSS - immersive
 technology/film) and impact (LSS/Education - STEAM school events).

 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society
 Collaboration
 Collaboration informs research at all levels. The school has maintained the leadership
 commitment to our cultural partners, and academic staff have vital strategic roles across the
 city’s cultural landscape and beyond (table 2). Strategic partnerships (TL, LB, FACT), have been
 maintained and developed, including annual investment of approx. £180,000 in the embedded
 posts, helping to develop research awareness, activity and collaborative labs (ICS3). The
 University Alliance and ACE published a 2016 white paper (‘A clearer picture: a guide for arts
 and cultural organisations engaging with universities’) citing the LJMU-TL partnership as an
 example of good practice, stating, “the joint academic post enables senior academics to
 contribute and advise on the research strategies of both the University and the Tate, including
 generating collaborative research income and enhancing the educational provision across both
 institutions”, noting that “collaborations between universities and arts organisations not only
 bring numerous benefits to the organisations involved, but also contribute to improvements
 within the local and national cultural landscape.” Following the success of this ‘academia in
 residence’, we introduced similar posts in RIBA North Gallery (2015-18) and JMPP (2018 to
 present), further investing (approx. £96,000 p.a.) into the cultural landscape of the city. LSAD
 also provided artist-in-residence, Hyatt, to Sensor City (2017-19): an LJMU-University of
 Liverpool specialist technology hub for entrepreneurs, start-ups, established companies and
 SMEs.
 IAT has developed important interdisciplinary collaborations with 25 major arts/cultural
 organisations, 4 major science and technology organisations, 6 public health organisations and
 15 academic institutions both nationally and internationally, leading to joint postgraduate
 research supervision (e.g., Transart Institute NY; University of Witwatersrand; University of
 Granada) and research relating to:
       urbanism [‘Creative zones to revitalise the economy’ with Luxun Academy of Fine Arts,
        Dalian Polytechnic University and Chinese National Academy of Painting, Beijing (City
        Lab); ‘Re-enchanting architecture’ with École Nationale Supérieure de Architecture de
        Paris-La Villette (City Lab); FD Festival with FINSA (CAL); ‘Translocal Urban Media’ with
        iMAL Brussels, Medialab Madrid, MSU Zagreb, Public Art Lab Berlin, Videospread
        Marseille, MUTEK Montréal, m-cult Helsinki and Media-Architecture Institute Vienna
        (ETL)];
       human origins and migration (Face Lab’s ‘Early Holocene People’ with Max Planck
        Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology; ‘Three Stories’ with University of Bergen; ‘Quest
        for Ancestral Faces’ with Museum of Gran Canaria)
       humanitarian issues (Face Lab’s ‘Migrant Disaster Victim Identification’ with Universities
        of La Laguna and Milan; ‘Skeletal Restitution’ with University of Cape Town).



                                                                                             Page 13
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
       codesign and curation ‘Who am I?’ with Johns Hopkins University and Archaeological
        Museum (Face Lab); Contemporary digital art commissions with Whitney Museum of
        American Art (ERL); ‘Uses of Art’ with Reina Sofia, MACBA, Van Abbemuseum, SALT,
        KASK, Moderna Galerija and MUKHA (City Lab);
       public health (City Lab’s ‘Design for Dementia’ with Merseycare NHS Trust and Dementia
        Care; ‘Arts Loco’ with Merseycare NHS Trust);
       heritage [Face Lab’s ‘Face of Robert the Bruce’ with University of Glasgow and
        Hunterian; ‘Robert Burns 4D portrait’ with University of Dundee and DI4D; ‘Punk
        Archives’ with British Library (CAL); ‘Afrobits’ with University of Lancaster (ETL);
        ‘Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral (LMC) Architectural Competition’ with LMC (City Lab)];
       digital futures [‘CloudMaker and ‘The Minecraft Of Things’ with FACT and MOSI (ETL);
        ‘Creative Labs’ with FutureLab Ars Electronica Linz (ETL)]

 Contribution to economy and society
 IAT’s impact strategy (p4) aspires to disseminate research power for the social good with strong
 civic purpose linked to the processes, institutions and communities of our city.
 2015 outcomes of ‘Artists’ City’ reached 111 artists, 980 participants, 13,200 live and 30,170
 mediated audience, delivered 286 performances/exhibition days, 86 new commissions, 200 days
 of artists’ employment, 108 education/participation sessions, writers’ competition and
 masterclass, and studios for 26 early career artists. Following this, IAT instigated and
 contributed to local festivals aligned to cultural regeneration; the city region of Islington (bottom
 5% income; top 10% crime in UK 2017) was rebranded as the Fabric District (FD) and, through
 cultural development, the region experienced social and economic regeneration. Hyatt joined
 the FD CIC Board, 2017, and initiated/curated the first FD Arts Festival (‘Time Tunnel’, 2018)
 rooted in the thematic research question, ‘What happened to the revolutionary creative spirit of
 May 1968?’. It included 40 original artworks, 4 original archive exhibitions, 3 fashion shows, 10
 public talks, 2 maker days and 6 performances, and reached 1035 visitors, receiving LCC
 recognition for the district, leading to significant economic growth (6 new venues and 9 new
 businesses). The Tapestry, converted from a derelict factory for ‘Time Tunnel’ Festival, won
 Inspired Spaces North 2018, and the pan-Liverpool greening strategy group, Green Umbrella
 (Hyatt), helped secure £260,000 funding from LCC and ESIF. The second Festival (Hyatt, 2019)
 reached 2031 visitors and included 13 exhibitions, 14 events, 55 presenters, 215 public
 participants, 2 maker workshops and 4 performances. These festivals generated further UK
 exhibition tours (‘Heartfield’ 2019/20) and regeneration strategies (‘Fab Art’ 2017). In 2019, IAT
 extended activity to Birkenhead (Hyatt’s Dark Side Art Lab and projects sponsored by FINSA),
 producing 2 installations, 1 conference, 2 research events, one PGT artist’s residency, 5
 exhibitions, and partnership with Open Eye Gallery and Look Festival, leading to a new umbrella
 collective, Left Bank 2020, to plan collaborative mini festivals. In 2019, Baltic Creative
 announced plans to build 35 FD creative/digital workspaces and pledged to support ‘aspirations
 to deliver a creatively-led regeneration of Birkenhead’. These festivals are now a sustainable
 legacy with local support, a strategy group, and a PGR student appointed to FD CIC Board,
 2020.
 ERL (Krysa) has been critical to the delivery of LB since 2014 through research-based curation
 and public programming, recognising that opportunities for local audiences to talk about art are
 critical to improving the reception of public art in the cultural life of the city and key to enhancing
 perceptions of contemporary art. To date, LB commissioned 340 artworks, presented 480
 international artists, and had economic impact of £119.6 million. LB2016 included 44 new
 commissions by international artists, 1.2 million audience, and an economic impact of £ 5.3M

 contribution to Liverpool and £5.5M to the North West (equivalent to 138 permanent full-time
 jobs). The RIBA North Gallery (Walsh) ran LB2018 events (‘Pop Goes the Technosphere’) to
 explore the intersection of architecture, technology and biology through a range of performative
 and immersive experiences rooted in principles of controlled ecological life support systems and
 emerging technologies and their expanding role in resilient architecture. Architecture students
 contributed to ‘Grow-It-Yourself’ mushroom workshops and talks with LB2018-commissioned
 designer, Dr Mae-ling Jovenes.
 Tate Exchange (TE) was set up by the Tate Collective (2016), responding to research that
 promotes the benefits of co-design, community collaboration and audience involvement, and has
 reached approx. 5,000 visitors weekly. Birchall sits on the programming panel (ICS3) and
 curated 14 programmes (total audience 100,914), 4 including other LSAD researchers: ‘The
 Perception Machine’ 2017 (Roughley and Smith, K, audience 5,325); ‘Calling Sheds’ 2019
 (MacKinnon-Day, audience 6,248); ‘The Famous Women Project’ 2019 (Leaper, audience
 6,738); ‘Perfume Stories and Narratives’ 2020 (O’Shaughnessy, audience 2,497); and a
 collaboration (Carroll) with Chester Aid to the Homeless 2018, a public event and exhibition by
 homeless people to challenge stereotypes (audience of 3,777). Through collaborations with
 science institutes, arts organisations, universities and government bodies across the world, Face
 Lab has demonstrated significant humanitarian, justice, heritage and cultural impact as a result
 of research relating to faces and identity (ICS2). Examples include culturally sensitive museum
 curation of human remains (USA; UK), controversial skeletal restitution (SA), and the British
 Academy funded project for West African migrant disaster victim identification (MDVI) in the
 Canaries. These projects were so significant as to shape international MDVI policy and historic
 reburials policy (ICS2). End-users have included international police services (Interpol, South
 African Police Service, Australian Federal Police, Abu Dhabi General Directorate), museums
 (table 3), policymakers (table 2) and humanitarian networks.

 Contribution to research base
 Since 2015, Krysa has co-curated LB, establishing a new online commissioning programme for
 digital works with The Whitney Museum of American Art (Moreshin Alleyhari, 2018, Ubermorgen,
 2020) and acting as co-commissioning editor of peer-reviewed Biennial research journal,
 ‘Stages’, (9,000 page views and 2,970 unique visits for Volumes 6-8). LB2014, 2016, 2018
 events in ERL have included one major artist exhibition each year (Suzanne Treister, Paul
 Elliman), residencies (Jorge Menna Barreto, Brazil; The Serving Library UK/US) and
 conferences/lecture series (‘Biennial Condition’ 2016, ‘Design and Empire’ 2017, ‘Beautiful
 World Where Are You?’ 2018). Between 2015-2019, ERL delivered a programme of 78 events
 including 14 exhibitions, 32 talks, 2 conferences, 7 residencies and 12 visiting researchers,
 (51,863 audience). LSAD and LB now have a sustainable future partnership, maintaining the
 peer reviewed research contribution, and with planned project-based PGR and staff curatorial
 contributions for future LBs through the joint Transart Institute-LSAD PGRs and MA Exhibition
 Studies.
 The public Luminary Lecture Series (Chuhan) have included Daniel Libeskind 2015, Jane and
 Louise Wilson 2016, Lance Wyman 2016, Sokari Douglas Camp 2017, Judy Chicago 2017,
 Alnoor Mitha 2018, Naiza Khan 2018, Christopher Le Brun 2019, Gilane Tawadros 2019 and
 Andrew Stahl 2020. The on-line repository since 2016 provides a lasting contribution.
 The long-term, strategic research and curatorial project (Fallows, 2000-ongoing), Punk and
 Counterculture Archives and Exhibitions (p12), is recognised as, “the world's foremost popular
 culture archive” (anthropologist/writer, Ted Polhemus, 2020) and this is used widely by
 international researchers, artists, designers and the public.
