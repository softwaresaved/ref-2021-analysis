 Unit of Assessment: Panel 6 Agriculture, Food and Veterinary Sciences

 1. Unit Context and Structure, Research and Impact Strategy

 The Royal Agricultural University has always positioned itself at the forefront of ‘applied
 research’ in agriculture, from its foundation 175 years ago, when the industrial revolution was
 realigning food supply systems, until today when the societal concern is how to feed humanity
 and conserve the land in a period of challenge and change. At present all the research at the
 RAU falls into the broad remit of UOA Panel 6, with some outlying research in enterprise,
 ecology and cultural heritage.

 Our research strategy is framed around three goals:

 Feeding the world in a changing climate
 Food insecurity is a central concern of government. With the UK hosting COP26 in November
 2021, there is even greater focus on the need to develop resilient, sustainable systems to
 optimise food production, promote animal welfare, and implement smart agri-technology
 solutions that will make food production more efficient, and achieve net-zero in agriculture by
 2040. Areas where the RAU’s research addresses these issues include: studies in animal feed
 amendments to reduce methane emissions; gaining greater understanding of appropriate
 cultivation methods; delivering precision-level inputs into crop and livestock production;
 maintaining soil health; and mapping carbon sequestration in the landscape.

 Sustaining and restoring the global environment
 In the face of climate change, globalisation, human population growth, loss of biodiversity and
 wild habitats and rapid urbanisation, the global environment is both directly and indirectly
 impacted. Our research strategy combines a holistic and technological focus to promote
 sustainability, landscape-level resilience and biodiversity, through agro-ecology, regenerative
 agriculture and regenerating communities, and keeping humans, plants and animals healthy.
 Central to this is our cross-research cluster expertise in food systems and their interface with
 ecological systems, and activities to develop societal engagement with the need to address
 landscape-level resilience and restorative strategies.

 Enabling and revitalising Global Britain in a Brexit and Covid world
 The socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on the UK and global economy is significant and will
 influence communities for generations to come. Strategies to revitalise, regenerate and enable
 recovery at local, national and international levels will be framed by shifts in social trends in an
 increasingly digital world. The need to “Build Back Better”, level up communities and create
 equal opportunity in the UK and across the world, to regenerate economically and drive export
 opportunities to new post-Brexit markets, will create opportunity but also require transition,
 transformation and change. Our critical expertise in disruptive products, technologies and
 leadership (including food safety, animal welfare, health and wellbeing, food and rural policy,
 enterprise and entrepreneurship, and agri-technology) will inform food and farming policy,
 alternative food production and food supply models, and rural enterprise and innovation.
 Providing innovative solutions to delivering outcomes-based policy forms an essential focus of
 our research strategy. Research to improve the perceptions of the UK as a “go to destination”

                                                                                                 Page 1

    will promote increased commercialisation of cultural heritage and agri-tourism. Our research in
    rural enterprise, food provenance, heritage and rural recreation will inform such economic
    growth. Rural pursuits enhance mental well-being and our work in equine health and welfare has
    nurtured a greener approach to this type of recreation, integrating it into farming systems and
    encouraging diversification and entrepreneurship within the rural economy.

    We see these three themes interlocking throughout our five research clusters. We undertake
    focused scientific research, spanning both the UK and Western and Eastern Europe, but we also
    have a significant global perspective, especially in our doctoral research community and through
    our active connections with China, Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa. The University’s approach to
    research has been formulated around collaborations between scientists, farmers and innovators.
    As we are located within a largely rural area, we have been able to leverage collaborations, and
    develop innovative research projects. This approach embraces farmer-science (a branch of
    citizen science)1 and farmer-led innovation networks,2 in which existing knowledge, skills and
    practice is widely acknowledged and developed. We have developed methodologies to measure
    stakeholder engagement and feedback. 3

    Sustainable and regenerative agriculture
    A key area of research has been in sustainable, regenerative agriculture, where we have built up
    a significant research expertise through new appointments, including Professors MacMillan and
    Horton, and at lecturer level, Crotty, Webber and O’Connor. A key part of this research has been
    to develop improved methods of cultivation, with nutrient recovery, low carbon agriculture, soil
    conservation and planting regimes, to enable long-term sustainability, achieving net zero-carbon,
    and healthier food. Underpinning this has been a long-term systematic experiment (LTE) at
    Harnhill Farm (we believe the only one in the world) ongoing for 11 years, in which three regimes
    (plough, minimum till, and direct drill) and three crops have been monitored across 18 plots.4
    This platform is used by our research cluster, to measure outputs (Cannon) from annual harvest,
    soil biology and worm density (Crotty) and micro-nutrients in soil and plant uptake (Webber),
    enabling us to connect outputs, nutrients, soil health and cultivation methods. Crotty has secured
    a STFC grant to develop worm density measures using AI on these plots. Webber’s research
    employs novel pXRF technology to link soil nutrients with plant uptake. Multispectral UAV
    imaging has also been employed to monitor crop growth over time. We have now converted the
    LTE to grass, as the farm converts to organic production, and will be monitoring the performance
    of the plots over the next five years.

    A second approach to increased sustainability in agriculture has been a range of projects, mostly
    undertaken as doctoral research, that examined how to improve outputs through regenerative
    methods – including crop establishment techniques, low input N efficiency management,

    mulching crop residues, red clover N accumulation,5 bi-cropping wheat and beans.6 One
    innovative project funded by industry, has examined robotic mechanical weeding, linked to
    UAV/AI tech focussing on blackgrass in wheat and so potentially reducing chemical inputs. We
    have employed farmer-science approaches to test the impact of soil temperature on spring
    fertilizer application.7

    Soil health remains at the centre of our research in sustainable agriculture, and by using this
    term we are acknowledging that we regard soil as a living ecosystem and not just an inert base
    for agriculture – and measuring the reliance of the soil to changes within agricultural
    management, food security and climate change is a key research goal.8 We have taken a global
    approach, examining the contribution of soil protists to biological functioning in Canada (funded
    by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada), as part of a large project examining the global distribution
    of earthworm diversity9 and the study of soil fungivorous microarthropods, using stable isotope
    ratio mass spectrometry. 10

    Agricultural and industrial activity is often detrimental to soil health owing to the distribution of
    harmful heavy metal(loid)s into the soil environment. In light of the rapid progress in the
    emerging field of stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry, the RAU was part of an international
    collaboration (with Tsinghua University, Imperial College, Princeton University, Karlsruhe
    Institute of Technology, Tianjin University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences) which
    performed a state-of-the-art investigation into how stable isotopes can be used in soil metal
    source identification, with a focus on distinct isotope signals of different sources as the key
    prerequisites for source apportionment.11 We have developed a novel method to map soil
    contamination using machine learning algorithms that can accurately interpret soil sample data
    combined with high-resolution aerial imaging.12 This novel approach overcomes the difficulty that
    highly heterogeneous soil environments create for traditional interpolation methods, such as
    Kriging. Furthermore, we carried out a study with Tsinghua University at a Cd contaminated
    agricultural site in the Yangzi River delta in the southeast of China. A human health-based risk
    assessment revealed that minimal risk mitigation measures could be applied; however, our
    comprehensive sustainability research showed that more rigorous remediation approaches had
    lower life-cycle environmental impacts and better performance in the social, economic, and
    agricultural aspects.

    Understanding the contribution of crop-based agriculture to climate change and biodiversity is
    one of the RAU’s key research areas and we are developing methods to measure soil carbon
    sequestration, 13 greenhouse gas emissions linked to organic food production,14 developing a

 better understanding of soil micro-nutrients at a granular level, so to reduce chemical inputs15
 and examining climate change impact in sub-Saharan Africa. 16 Connected to our approach to
 regenerative agriculture has been research into the agri-ecosystem. Working with the ecological
 charity Plantlife (part of Natural England’s Back from the Brink and the Millennium Seed Bank)
 K. Hemmings and Grange have been able to reintroduce the critically-endangered arable plant,
 Red Hemp Nettle (Galeopsis angustifolia) and are currently working on Spreading Hedge
 Parsley (Torilis arvensis), with results expected in Spring 2021. Our research on the agri-ecology
 of woodland, field margins and hedgerows focuses on their potential for biodiversity
 enhancement and carbon sequestration. Grange’s estimates for carbon storage in hedge
 biomass was one of the first studies to do so. Grange and colleagues are also now working on
 the ecosystem services linked to trees in the farmed landscape. Studies based around long term
 experiments for up to 10 years and published in Conservation Evidence include the impact of
 bracken control in conservation management,17 conservation grazing experiments (some using
 molasses to encourage selective grazing)18 studies of wood decomposition to encourage bird
 nesting, and of ancient woodland indicators. 19

 One novel approach in agricultural production, developed at the RAU, relates to the use of
 natural products for improving health in humans20 and reducing pest damage in agricultural
 crops.21 A project to optimize the galanthamine content of daffodil biomass identified several
 alkaloids which are important for human health, including galanthamine which is now being used
 to treat Alzheimer’s disease, and lycorine which is being assessed for its potential to limit the
 spread and distribution of the Covid-19 virus. We have also undertaken studies in the
 biosynthesis of alkaloids from plants22 and explored cultivation of lycoris in China. The RAU is
 currently part of a project on sustainable daffodil-derived galanthamine production in the
 uplands23 and during the REF cycle we have completed 7 galanthamine-related funded projects
 associated with research degrees.

 In understanding food systems in sub-Saharan Africa, our research has taken an ethnographic
 and archaeological approach, being sensitive to the local heritage and tradition. The RAU has
 led a major AHRC/GCRF-funded project on East Pemba (Zanzibar, Tanzania) that has
 examined the sustainable maritime cultural heritage of one of the poorest areas of the East
 African coast. The project is part of the Network+ Rising from the Depths, and has focused on
 fisheries, shellfish and seaweed production, and associated material culture and traditional
 fishing boat construction, looking in particular at the role of women in food production. This
 project developed out of previous work on shell fishing on Mafia island24 and archaeological
 researches on Zanzibar. Horton’s active fieldwork with the Max Planck Institute for the Science

 of Human History has placed the globalisation of food systems (both plants and animals) within
 a tight historical, archaeological and genetic framework. 25

 Livestock health and welfare
 The focus of our research into livestock is to provide scientific support for welfare and animal
 health improvement. This has two directions: to provide robust welfare outcome methodologies
 that can be used in a commercial context; and to develop farmer-led innovation networks
 (FLIN).26

 We have built up a significant research expertise through new appointments, including Professor
 Main and at a lecturer level Stokes, Giebel, Zaleska and Smith. A key focus of the work (by
 Main, Stokes, van Dijk, Bull) has been the development of welfare-outcome research methods
 that are relevant in a commercial context including the adoption of outcomes measures in farm
 assurance schemes.27 Recently the work has been extended to consider the economic and
 policy value of positive welfare/good life opportunities in livestock species.28 We have also
 developed calf welfare assessment measures.29 The appointment of Giebel has increased our
 expertise in epidemiology which will enable us to extend quantitative approaches to animal
 health and welfare.30 Two PhD projects include improving dairy beef production systems through
 industry participation and the study of welfare in Farm Animals in the UK. Other doctoral work
 (Manning, Stokes, Muhammad) is focusing on sheep welfare and the development of a positive
 welfare framework to support knowledge exchange activities with farmers and industry
 stakeholders.

 FLIN was founded by the RAU (van Dijk) in October 2018 to share knowledge and experiences
 and provide a collective advocacy voice for farmers directly involved in these initiatives. The
 main aim of FLIN is to understand, learn from and ‘power up’ farmer-led research and innovation
 initiatives in the UK and increase the impact of these kind of initiatives across the industry.
 Currently, over 20 organisations involved in farmer-led innovation and research initiatives are
 part of this network, including governmental and non-governmental organisations, research
 institutes, the levy boards, farmer organisations and advisory services. The network brings
 together an estimate of at least 1,500 farmers directly involved in farmer-led research and
 innovation across the UK (and over 3,000 farmers in initiatives engaging farmers in like-minded
 types of processes but with a less specific focus on innovation). In the first year of the network,
 two network meetings took place, one face-to face and one virtual, and several workshops were
 organised to share experiences, including an Innovation Facilitation workshop. Initial work was
 commissioned to make an inventory of the monitoring and evaluation approaches and tools used
 by the network members and how to develop better, more structured and potentially monetized
 evaluation of the success and effectiveness of these types of initiatives.

 A critical theme of the RAU’s work, which is also relevant for other agriculture disciplines, is the
 utilisation of existing knowledge and the motivation to adopt technical innovations. This has

 included adoption of motivational interviewing communication strategies31 from medical
 disciplines, participatory famer action groups32 and farmer-led innovation networks.33
 Furthermore, the RAU (Main, Stokes, van Dijk, Bull) is collaborating in the EU Horizon 2020
 EURAKNOS34 project and its sister project EUREKA35. These two projects bring together 21
 multi-actors from 16 member states and 48 supporting organizations, to co-create a stronger
 and reinforced EU wide agricultural knowledge base by developing an open-source e-platform
 (knowledge reservoir). The future of innovation in European agriculture and forestry is based on
 the improved (digital) exchange of best practices between farmers, researchers and advisors
 from different sectors and member states. The EURAKNOS and EUREKA projects aim to
 ensure the longer-term and wider use by farmers, foresters and other rural businesses of the
 practical knowledge and innovative solutions that are generated by Horizon 2020 multi-actor
 projects. The RAU is leading the work on understand knowledge demand through profiling the
 needs and preferences of end-users; this will help to inform the actual design of the platform as
 well as verifying the preferred communication and dissemination channels used by end-users.

 Food policy, quality and security
 The scope of this research cluster is to consider food supply as a subset of wider food systems;
 therefore, the research described here is both multi-disciplinary and multifaceted. What lies at
 the heart of the collective research activity is considering food supply as a socio-economic and a
 socio-technical system. Socio-technical systems inform food safety, food supply and the moral
 framing and behaviours in supply chains. Extensive collaborative research by Manning36 has
 been undertaken in this area, especially in the area of risk assessment,37 product, process38 and
 personal integrity39 and food supply chain governance.40 Food waste has been a topic of
 research interest with publications by Manning41 and Michel-Villarreal. Main and Stokes have
 supported this area of research with work on the ethical and economic impacts of promoting
 good lives for livestock.42 There has been work across the cluster on aspects of sustainable
 value creation including social value (Ravenscroft)43 via farmers’ markets (Michel-Villarreal)44
 and alternative food networks (Michel-Villarreal),45 and sustainable value (Manning).46

 Doctoral research is focusing on rural-urban food linkage in the UK, Nigeria and Tanzania and
 the development of alternative food models. Further doctoral research is considering food safety
 standards in developing countries and how to develop mechanisms to reduce foodborne disease
 outbreaks, and traceability mechanisms to inform food safety management.

 One area of research activity is the functioning of the international sugar market, and how this is
 influencing sugar production in India, which is seeing a shift away from sugar as a food supply,
 and towards it being a source of ethanol. 47 Doctoral research within this cluster has a strongly
 international focus, with two projects in Nigeria, examining the impact of climate change on
 agricultural productivity, and the economic implications and causes of agricultural food shortage
 in Nigeria. Research on the efficiency of the international sugar market builds on the studies by
 Bozward. Manning has also been collaborating with the Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso
 do Sul in Brazil with research exploring resilience in the sugar and ethanol sector.48

 Equine science
 The cluster’s research focuses on the relationship between equine behavioural neuroscience,
 gastric health and dietary manipulation of stabled performance horses, and makes a significant
 contribution of horse welfare. The holistic approach involves behavioural and physical health
 profiling to elucidate the triggers of gut dysbiosis and aberrant behaviours. The team has
 developed several innovative testing methods that are effective, non-invasive and low cost, but
 with high animal welfare impact. Much focus has been directed towards improving gut and
 respiratory health by developing novel feeds, pre-feeding treatments that remove airborne
 particles from fodder to reduce respiratory diseases, and increasing the understanding of
 stereotypy behaviour (crib biting) and its underlying causes.49

 Hemmings has developed post-mortem brain receptor studies that focus on dopamine and
 opioid systems50 and uses non-invasive behavioural and cognitive indicators of brain activity, for
 use in the living horse. The long-term aim is to develop brain-focused indicators of equine
 welfare status, cognitive profile, temperament and predictors of competition performance in
 equine athletes.51 He uses cognitive markers to predict trainability in situations that require
 impulse control temperament and performance using the 3-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task.52
 Another approach has been the Spontaneous Eye Blink Rate53 as a welfare and temperament
 measurement tool and as an indicator of brain dysfunction.

 Moore-Colyer has developed nutrition systems to improve gut and respiratory health54, identified
 disease-inducing respiratory allergens55 and mapped the microbial profiles in fodder. The work
 focuses on the effect that pre-feeding treatments have on the nutrient and hygienic quality of
 feed and the impact these have on the gastro-intestinal metabolome.56 A strong element of this
 research has been industrial partnerships (Haygain Ltd, Eclipse Feeds, Natural Animal Feeds,
 ADM and Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition), enabling the research insights to be translated into
 practical products. Two examples are: (i) the investigation into the efficacy of the total mixed

 Daniel’s research focuses on intestinal health and prevention of intestinal dysbiosis in horses
 which is the most significant cause of colic and death in the UK horse population.59 This work
 includes parasitology focused on anthelmintic efficacy via nematode egg reappearance times,
 the ovicidal efficacy of fenbendazole in populations of resistant cyathostomins, and efficacy
 testing in working equids.60 The fundamental parasitology has extended to investigating the
 effect of anthelmintic on the hindgut microbiomes structure and mechanistic function61, to
 understand risks of parasite treatment and intestinal disease seen in horses. Gut health
 research includes understanding the microbiota of feeds.62 In vivo digestibility trials are ongoing
 to support the development of the in vitro gut model microbiome and gut brain axis work.

 Sustaining the rural economy and landscape.
 Researchers at the RAU understand that the land and landscape is a dynamic entity, the product
 of millennia of human curation, and a delicate relationship between productive activity – that
 includes farming and rural enterprise – and the conservation of the environment (both historic
 and green). We have a unique blend of specialists that undertake research on rural enterprise
 and regeneration, including economists, geographers, planners and heritage and agri-business
 specialists. We are part of the National Innovation Centre for Rural Enterprise (NICRE) along
 with the Universities of Newcastle, Warwick, and Gloucestershire, supported by Research
 England and industry partners. Established in 2020, this initiative aims to shift the policy about
 rural enterprise through research into the rural economy. One interest lies in artisan
 entrepreneurs, often small rural businesses with highly specialised skills such as food producers
 or creative artists. Inge Hill’s research examines micro-entrepreneurship suggesting methods
 considering socio-materiality for studying the development of business exchange relations.
 Central to this research has been the development of a theoretical framework and fine-grained
 ethnographic methods, which have not been used hitherto in this field. Hill’s research examines
 methods of data capture and the study of micro-entrepreneurship and socio-materiality within
 artisan entrepreneurs.63

 Gloucestershire has been greatly affected by bovine TB, and the RAU played an important role
 in understanding farmer behaviour and compliance. This work was undertaken by Naylor, in
 collaboration with the University of Gloucestershire and UWE, and adopted a social science
 approach. The initial multi-disciplinary longitudinal project, completed in 2015, was in support of

 the DEFRA Badger Vaccination Deployment Project. It explored farmers’ levels of confidence in
 vaccinating badgers against bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) and helped to inform the Government’s
 bTB strategy.64 A second project 2014-16, supported by a DEFRA social science research
 fellowship, focused on farmer compliance with mandatory and voluntary bTB disease control
 measures and an evaluation of new risk communication methods developed by DEFRA and
 informed the development of new intervention measures. The third project, in 2015, explored
 livestock-keepers’ experiences and their responses to different disease payment mechanisms
 and directly informed DEFRA’s exotic disease compensation policy.65

 One example of European collaboration has been the study of sustainability of goat and sheep
 farms in Europe, which analysed 206 farms in Greece, Italy, Spain, Finland and the UK as part
 of a Horizon 2020 project.66 Another examined the productivity and economic evaluation of
 agroforestry systems in comparison to sustainable food production in Denmark and the UK.67

 Impact and knowledge exchange strategy
 Our knowledge exchange and impact strategy is central to our institutional mission to support
 the land-based sector, rural enterprises and agri-technology innovation. This strategy seeks to
 increase prosperity and build a bridge between rural and urban civic society through a dynamic
 integration of science, policy and practice. Our knowledge exchange activity is driven by
 societal needs and is focused on collaborating expertly with government, industry, civic society
 and other academic institutions, as well as the involvement of students in real-world learning.
 We use evidence-based, practice-led approaches to support policy makers through thought
 leadership, and we provide professional development programmes and business support, and
 create space for innovation and entrepreneurial business acceleration.

 The RAU’s vision for impact and KE for the next 10 years is to become the leading research
 intensive, specialist HEI focused on the land, economy and food-supply sectors, collaborating
 expertly with government, industry, civic society and other academic institutions, in the UK and
 around the world. This strategy seeks a dynamic integration of science, social science, policy
 and practice and must be enabled by rigorous underlying scientific research. We are developing
 this approach in line with the KE Concordant which we have joined.

 Our underpinning knowledge exchange mission is: “To impact industry, government, employers
 and rural and urban communities by providing focused thought leadership, relevant research
 outputs and shaping policy through the development of dedicated interfaces with our
 stakeholders.” This mission is supported and framed by innovative research and by
 disseminating best practice.

 Future research projects
 In April 2021, we are launching the Centre for Effective Innovation in Agriculture (CEIA) at the
 RAU, funded by the Elizabeth Creek Foundation. This is a collaboration between five agricultural
 universities to put farmer priorities at the heart of innovation research. This centre aims to
 increase the adoption of innovation by farmers, by helping scientists and research funders better
 align their effort and investments with user needs.

 We have been awarded a major research grant as part of a European consortium, from Horizon
 2020, to research the pathways for transitions to sustainability in livestock husbandry and food
 systems. The overall goal of the PATHWAYS project is to inform policy, research and business
 strategies in support of a transition to more sustainable animal protein production and
 consumption. This will be achieved through improved characterisation and assessment of
 current livestock systems, identifying the potential trade-offs and synergies of innovations, and
 through developing and evaluating sustainable development scenarios to derive credible,
 relevant and effective transition pathways for the livestock sector. To reach its overall goal, the
 project will combine novel and scientifically supported holistic sustainability assessment
 methodologies with a wide range of national practice hubs (involving the main livestock species)
 and collaborations with international stakeholder networks. Together, these groups comprise
 innovative agents for livestock-system transitions (IALTs) and supply chain actors, who can
 identify, assess and support innovations and identify transition pathways.

 Our recently funded FOODLEVERS project (funded by DEFRA through SUSFOOD2 and CORE
 ORGANIC Co-fund, worth £100,000) investigates sustainability transitions and aims to identify
 key leverage points to develop and scale up existing innovative organic and sustainable food
 systems in order to promote higher resource-efficiency, highlight inefficiencies and specify the
 reasons for decision-making that led to the configuration of the food systems. Rethinking the
 organisation of sustainable and organic food systems value chains in this way is necessary to
 increase the sustainability and efficiency of food systems and to reduce trade-offs between
 production/distribution stages. The project will analyze several European case studies of
 innovative organic food systems and innovative sustainable systems and identify best practice
 processes from multiple perspectives of resource efficiency: environment, economy, social and
 governance.

 A further area of future research will explore an environmentally benign combination of
 biopesticides. Xianmin Chang is part of a £1.2m Sino/UK Newton Fund project, Transforming
 Pest Control in Chinese and UK Agriculture (RAU/Greenwich University/AgroPy (UK) Ltd). This
 project will improve ecosystem welfare through the development of an environmentally benign
 pesticide that combines effective but non-persistent botanical pesticides with entomopathogenic
 fungi (EPF) to create a pest control solution for sustainable pest management in China and the
 UK.

 The livestock health and welfare research group has been awarded two projects this year likely
 to have both major policy and commercial impacts. A DEFRA-funded project is exploring the
 potential opportunities for public money for ‘public goods’ payments in a welfare-enhancement
 framework across all major livestock species, and to shape policy for higher farm animal welfare
 payments post Brexit. This project seeks to embed the ‘good life’ framework which we have
 been developing with farmers and farm assurance schemes over the last few years for chickens,

                                                                                             Page 10
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 cows and sheep. The group has also developed a research contract with a major chicken
 restaurant company to explore the system changes necessary to deliver animal welfare and
 sustainability objectives.

 Working with the animal feed nutritional company Nutri-San, Main and Horton are developing
 two projects around seaweed additives to feed, to improve animal health and reduce methane
 emissions. One has developed from the East Pemba project, to investigate cultivation of
 different species that hitherto are only found in the wild, and the second to look at the health
 impact of seaweed additives on cattle and chicken.

 The equine science research group is developing an in vitro gut model (with Wageningen
 University, University of Utrecht, Netherlands and University of Glasgow) that addresses the 3Rs
 (refine, reduce and replace) recommendations when using animals in research, so we can
 replace horses with accurate in-lab assessment to study new feeds, dietary interactions, impact
 of medications on the gut microbiome, and the study of gastrointestinal diseases.

 We aim to develop research on the economic contribution of rural creative industries, as engines
 of economic redevelopment in rural areas, aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals
 and have two grant applications outstanding for these research projects. We are also increasing
 our focus on soil health, biodiversity, and agri-tech, with grant applications for sensor
 development to understand earthworm ecology and movement within the field.

 2. People

 (Our university-wide policies are set out in REF5A in more detail). The RAU is a small specialist
 institution with an academic staff establishment of 58 (54 FTE). During the REF cycle, our policy
 has been, where possible, to recruit research-active academic staff, and to have an open process
 for the identification of existing staff as having SRR through our Code of Practice. The
 University’s Recruitment and Selection Policy outlines our commitment to recruit high quality
 staff within a fair process, free from bias and discrimination and focused on merit and ability. It
 details a well-planned process that is timely, supports the strategic direction of the University
 and withstands external scrutiny and audit. New appointments who are research active have
 research included in their contracts. The REF cycle has also seen the appointment of six new
 professors, of which five have been external appointments and one an internal promotion.
 Through restructuring of our academic establishment, the proportion of research-active
 academics has doubled from 17% to 33%. With open-door encouragement for our academics to
 transfer to SRR status and new appointments, we hope to achieve 50% SRRs during the next
 five years.

 Our research-active staff (including non-SRRs) are part of a research academy, which provides
 administrative support, advice on grant writing and planning, as well as financial advice. The
 academy has a budget to arrange research activities, including seminars and events as well as to
 operate the laboratories. The Director of Research attends the annual staff appraisals of
 research-active academic staff and mentors all new appointments. In the staff work-load model,
 30% of research-active staff time is allocated to research. All staff are required to place their
 publications onto the University Repository.




                                                                                            Page 11
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 The RAU has a franchise agreement with the University of Gloucestershire (UoG) for the award
 of research degrees. Research students, studying for both doctorates and MRes degrees are
 registered at the RAU and are allocated two supervisors and have a minimum of once-monthly
 meetings. Students are able to develop their research methodology skills via two taught modules
 run by UoG and on successful completion they are awarded PG Cert in Research Methods.
 Additional courses in data analyses run by Bristol University are also offered. Project design and
 writing skills are developed through production of a formal project proposal and feedback is given
 by an independent reviewer. Each year students develop their presentation skills through weekly
 Research Workshops and specific PG seminar days. A wide range of PG-relevant on-line
 material is available on our VLE PG support page, and discussion sessions on a variety of skills
 are regularly held. Opportunities to develop teaching skills are offered via demonstrating in UG
 classes. Students are encouraged and supported financially, through a designated fund, to
 present papers at academic conferences.

 The RAU is fully committed to a diverse staff and student community. 50% of our research
 students come from sub-Sahara Africa, and 6% of University staff are BAME. Eight out of 18 staff
 submitted in this Unit of Assessment are female (44%), as are 2 out of 6 professors (33%).



 3. Income, Infrastructure and Facilities

 Research income, as recorded in the HESA returns for the period 2013-2020 was £1,421,000,
 and largely comprised grants from charities and local and central government. However, recent
 grant success from UKRI, including GCRF/AHRC, STFC and Horizon Europe from 2019 signal a
 development in our funded research strategy, and as a consequence an uplift in our research
 income, which has increased by 88% over the last three years.68 Research income recorded
 from 2020 continues this upward trend and we anticipate an annual research income of £500k
 from 2022.

 As a land-based institution, the RAU’s principal research infrastructure is located in our farms
 and associated property. We lease Coates Manor Farm (194 ha.) and the Fossehill Equestrian
 Centre, while at Harnhill Farm we have the John Oldacre Rural Innovation Centre with wet
 laboratory facilities and workshops for primary fieldwork. We operate an access agreement with
 the Bathurst Estate, which provides access to 3,150 ha. of arable land for research purposes as
 well as extensive forestry, grassland and parkland.

 An important new initiative has been the designation of a living land lab, an area of 8.5 ha. within
 the campus area. Established in 2020, this is now being used for a variety of research projects,
 including plots for monitoring plant yield, soil health and cultural heritage research, and the re-
 introduction of rare arable plants. We are planning further research projects in this area with
 industrial partners and members of Farm491, as well as being part of the Wild Campus Project.

 Our 650m2 laboratory space has facilities for chemistry, microbiology, dissection and a clean
 room. Fully equipped for agricultural science, they include furnaces, freezers, fume cupboards,
 particle grinders, and homogenizers, with analytical equipment that includes HPLC, PCR, total
68
  There is a discrepancy in the HESA reported figures of £121k with some of our research income
for 2019-2020 (validated through TRAC) returned under ‘Other’. The total research income figure
for 2019-2020 is £239k.
                                                                                             Page 12

 carbon and nitrogen analyzer, atomic adsorption analyzer, Tullgrem funnel, and invertebrate
 extractors. The genetics facilities in the clean room includes an end-point and real-time (qPCR)
 machines along with standard gel electrophoresis equipment. There is also an Agilent 2100
 Bioanalyzer for rapid lab-on-a-chip analysis of DNA, RNA or proteins. In 2021, we are planning
 to establish a research campus, adjacent to the living land lab with newly equipped laboratories,
 200m2 research laboratory space for post-graduate and staff research, a big-data centre and
 dedicated post-graduate study space.

 At the Fossehill Equestrian centre we have dedicated stabling for up to 80 horses, 30m x 60m
 enclosed floodlit outdoor arena, a 1,000m all-weather gallop track, a horse walker and a ‘stick
 and ball’ outdoor exercise area. We use dedicated stalls for the research ponies which are part of
 a collaborative agreement with Glasgow University and are used for a variety of PGR and
 commercial in vivo digestive physiology and behaviour trials. We also have the use of the livery
 polo ponies (approximately 30) for observational behaviour and exercise physiology monitoring.

 As part of the impact and KE infrastructure the University completed the £4.2m Alliston Centre, a
 state-of-the-art incubation hub for agri-tech. Funded by GFirst LEP and the RAU, this Growth Hub
 provides 1,342m2 of space to enable academic research to interact and create impact with
 innovators, who are part of Farm491, an RAU initiative to support and accelerate agri-business.

 In 2020, through a partnership with Swindon Borough Council, the University acquired a £1.8m
 facility in the former railway village, for research and teaching in cultural heritage, located
 adjacent to the HQ of the UK’s national heritage bodies that will enable our land-based research
 to influence national policy.

 4. Collaboration and Contribution to the Research Base, Economy and Society

 Our evidence-based, practice-led approach to research means that RAU academics support
 policy makers through thought leadership in industry, government and civil society organisations,
 as well as engaging in product development. Through our short, long and on-line professional
 development programmes in rural, agricultural and agri-food supply chain management and
 leadership, we provide individuals with the skills and strategic insight required to effectively lead
 and manage businesses. We aim to enable innovation and local growth through the provision of
 innovation support services, access to knowledge hubs/platforms and space for innovation. Our
 academics use innovative approaches to facilitate collaboration and co-learning with students,
 farmers, charities and businesses through learning labs and farm, land-based and supply chain
 practice-led innovation.

 Our cross-institution programmes support rural entrepreneurship acceleration, enabling wider
 and deeper stakeholder partnerships to deliver national (Industrial Strategy) and place based
 (GFirst LEP) priorities. Central to this approach is the creation of pathways for business and
 social enterprise development within our student, alumni and local communities through the
 Cirencester Growth Hub, and agri-technology start-ups and growth-stage companies through the
 Farm491 programme. Furthermore, the Farm491 Knowledge Hub and our work on a European
 level agricultural e-knowledge reservoir provide opportunities for knowledge sharing and
 exchange.




                                                                                              Page 13
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 Below are listed ten examples of the impact of our research on industry, society and government
 policy (see also our two impact case studies):

       •   Professor Tom MacMillan has been undertaking in a central role in developing the
           National Food Strategy as policy advisor to Henry Dimbleby, and in compiling and
           writing the report of the Food Farming and Countryside Commission. 69 The NFS focuses
           on the urgent challenges relating to COVID-19 and Brexit and has had a direct impact on
           policy in the areas where it made recommendations. MacMillan provided strategic advice
           and research support, designing and commissioning research which included
           stakeholder engagement, polling on the future of work in the farming sector, polling on
           public attitudes to COVID-19, and an analytical review of 1,000 relevant previous policy
           recommendations. He was involved in establishing the Food, Farming & Countryside
           Commission, and has advised it as a consultant (first as Research Director, then Expert
           Advisor) since its inception, contributing to its strategic development, co-developing novel
           methods of inquiry (e.g. a UK-wide rural bike tour involving dozens of researchers over
           seven months) outputs and impact. He co-authored the final report of the Commission’s
           inquiry, which was welcomed by the Secretary of State and received international media
           coverage. Ongoing work to implement the Commission’s recommendations includes:
           work with the Environment Minister in Wales to develop a national nature service; work
           with the Geospatial Commission on strategic frameworks for land use; and analysis of
           agro-ecological land use scenarios in the UK. A poll MacMillan led for the Commission in
           April 2020 that found that that only 9% of people wanted a total return to normal after
           lockdown, was widely reported and continued to be cited in media stories throughout the
           year.
       •   Professor David Main and other leading animal welfare academics at the university have
           been active in the global animal welfare agenda. This has included a high-level workshop
           on a “UK Vision for World Leading Animal Welfare: Role of Public Goods Payments” with
           senior policymakers in government, industry and civil society, and drafting of a
           collaborative policy position by Farm Animal Welfare Forum in August 2019. The work on
           reducing antibiotics in the dairy beef sector has continued and there has been multi-level
           stakeholder engagement to support this critical public health and animal welfare agenda.
       •   The work of FLIN members and specifically Professor MacMillan have contributed to an
           increased commitment of DEFRA to invest in farmer-centred R&D and an overall
           increase in focus on the need to engage farmers and growers to ensure uptake and use
           of innovative technologies and practices. The launch of the Farming Innovation Pathways
           research funding call is an example of this commitment.
       •   Dr Jessica Stokes has been leading a co-design process with DEFRA which is
           investigating options for public payments for animal welfare, including adopting positive
           welfare practices. In addition, RAU research (Stokes, Main) on positive welfare and
           promoting good life was included in the February 2020 DEFRA policy statement, The
           Future for Food, Farming and the Environment.
       •   Dr Nicola Cannon has been collaborating with Cotswold Seeds for over 12 years to
           investigate how grass and grass legume species mixtures impact subsequent crop
           growth.70 The results demonstrated the benefits of including red clover in grass mixtures

           to reduce synthetic fertiliser requirement in the subsequent crop.71 The next stage
           determined if different red clover traits impact the nitrogen fixation and therefore
           subsequent benefit to the following crop 72 so reducing nitrogen fertilisers manufactured
           using the Haber Bosch process which has a high energy requirement and acts as a
           major barrier to net-zero cropping systems. Cotswold Seeds used this information for
           advising farmers on suitable species mixtures and the most suitable red clover varieties
           to optimise nitrogen fixation and they developed these research themes further with the
           development of FarmEd and crop rotations trial. Results from this work have been jointly
           presented at conferences and these farming systems are being considered as
           sustainable farming systems within the ELMS payment scheme which is currently under
           development.
       •   Dr Xianmin Chang developed a template for a completely new industry around daffodil
           production and processing of alkaloid production which is scalable, sustainable and
           environmentally friendly, and it will significantly reduce the price of drug production. In
           addition to galathamine production which is now used for Alzheimer’s treatment, we,
           together with a commercial partner, are working with 12 other universities in research
           into other alkaloids, e.g. Lycorine, Home-Lycorine, Haemanthamine, Tazettine, and
           Narciclasine, that may offer potential treatments for virus infections, heart failure, cancer
           (glioma), inflammatory, impact Protozoa in ruminant digestion which eliminates methane
           production.
       •   Professor Horton’s research on the East Pemba project is leading to significant
           international investment in the local seaweed industry for the introduction of new species,
           which are of much higher market value and which can significantly contribute to long
           term GHG reduction. The project has also installed new museum displays (replacing the
           closed and recently collapsed National Museum) that highlight the importance of the
           maritime and coastal sector.
       •   Professor Louise Manning was asked to provide written evidence to the EFRA
           Committee considering COVID-19 and food supply, and also contributed to
           Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST) publications on supply chain
           resilience. Manning was also a member of the Institute of Food Science and Technology
           COVID-19 Advisory Group which created a COVID-19 Knowledge Hub for food operators
           and the group worked with external Government agencies and departments in
           developing resilient food supply policy during the pandemic.73
       •   Through the research on disease-inducing respiratory allergens, Professor Moore-Colyer
           and Dr Hemmings developed pre-feeding treatments of horse feed with industrial
           partners so significantly improving horse welfare across the world (one of our impact
           case studies). Moore-Colyer and Daniels collaborated with Eclipse Feeds (Ireland) to
           design a total fibre mixed ration to be fed to thoroughbred foals to encourage steady
           healthy growth and development without detrimental effect on joints or gastrointestinal
           health, both of which can be side effects of traditional high cereal74 diets, and the product
           has just been launched as Foal to Yearling TMR.75

    •   Dr Naylor’s research in understanding farmer behaviour and compliance during the
        bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) epidemic, helped frame government policy on disease control
        measures. The first project explored farmers’ levels of confidence in vaccinating badgers
        against bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) and helped to inform the Government’s bTB strategy.
        A second project focused on farmer compliance with control measures and informed the
        development of new intervention measures. A third project in 2015 explored livestock-
        keepers’ experiences with different disease payment mechanisms and informed DEFRA
        exotic disease compensation policy.
