 Context and Structure
 The School of Engineering at the University of Aberdeen is a General Engineering academic
 Unit with research that spans the main engineering disciplines. Within the REF period the Unit
 has increased substantially in size and in the scope of its research. This submission comprises
 69.4 fte research academics, an increase of 77% on the REF2014 submission, with 36 fte
 research academics recruited within the REF period. The substantial growth was predicated by
 the Unit’s successful REF2014 outcome and its ability to respond to government, industry, and
 university research initiatives. The increase in size and expansion in research capability have
 enabled the Unit to make substantial research contributions that address major societal
 challenges: environmental sustainability, the circular economy, renewable energy infrastructure
 and technologies, decarbonisation, carbon capture and utilisation, and energy transition. The
 Unit has engaged fully with the Scottish Government’s OGIC (Oil and Gas Innovation Centre)
 and the Aberdeen Region City Deal’s OGTC initiatives aimed at accelerating technology
 developments within the energy industry. It is home to the Leverhulme Centre for Doctoral
 Training (CDT) in Sustainable Production of Chemicals and Materials, and leads the National
 Decommissioning Centre, which was established in 2019 to develop technologies and strategies
 for the economic and environmentally sensitive decommissioning of redundant offshore
 infrastructure. Research in chemical engineering and petroleum engineering, which were new in
 2014, has developed strongly within the period, while research in well-established subject areas,
 such as applied dynamics, fluid mechanics, power electronics and Internet engineering, has
 been sustained and developed, well supported by EU, UKRI and industry funding. At the same
 time, new areas of research are emerging, supported by recent recruitment, which will frame the
 Unit’s research strategy for the coming period. These include a wide range of research relating
 to the energy transition challenge, but also robotics and bioengineering, for which new staff have
 brought expertise ranging from bioinspired robotics to prosthetics design.
 The Unit’s research is conducted within 5 main research groups, which are based on
 commonality of discipline and scientific approach, rather than commonality of challenge or
 application area: Applied Mechanics; Chemical and Materials Engineering; Electrical and
 Electronic Engineering; Fluid Mechanics; Petroleum Engineering. The group structure
 promotes a strong research culture, teamwork, and mutual support. Each group is led by a
 senior academic, has an annual research budget and organises research seminars and events
 that promote the work of the group. Research across groups is common, strongly promoted and
 supported by the general engineering structure and philosophy of the Unit, and the Unit leads
 major multi-disciplinary research themes across the institution (Leverhulme CDT, National
 Decommissioning Centre, Centre for Transport Research). Research governance within the Unit
 follows the institution’s Handbook for Research Governance, which complies with the
 commitments set out in the Universities UK Concordat to Support Research Integrity. Training in
 research ethics and research integrity is mandatory for all researchers and PhD students, and all
 researchers have responsibility to report any allegation of unacceptable research conduct. Open
 access to research data and publications is a key part of the Unit’s impact and engagement
 strategy (details of how open access is supported are given in Section 3).

  Research Achievements and Strategy
  The Unit’s research activities and achievements within the REF period, and its strategic goals for
  the future, are described in what follows.
  The Applied Mechanics Research Group combines two areas of established research
  strength in applied dynamics and solid mechanics, while expanding the research scope to
  include new work on structures, reliability, and optimisation. The group comprises 23.2 fte
  researchers, 9 of whom were appointed within the REF period and 2 of whom are ECRs. The
  Group’s research in applied dynamics (Akisanya, Aleyassin, Pavlovskaia, Vaziri, Wiercigroch)
  uses a combination of modelling and experiments to study the fundamental behaviour of
  dynamic systems to optimise design and performance. A major area of focus is on drilling
  technologies, covering bit-rock interactions, rock modelling, drill-string dynamics, and application
  of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Initially supported by ITI Energy/Scottish
  Enterprise (£1.6M, 2012-2019) and industry (BG Group, £312k, 2011-2015), the research has
  been well supported by OGIC and various industry partners within the REF period (£680k in
  total, 2017-2020). It has led to optimised designs for single and multiple cutters in rotary drill bits,
  strategies for active and passive control of drill-string vibration, AI-based processes for well
  integrity assessment and new techniques for improved coring performance (e.g. 187317927 [1],
  187317931, 100697678, 100697792). The work led to a spin-out company in 2020 (iVDrill Ltd.)
  to commercialise these technologies. Other work in applied dynamics includes development of
  vortex-induced vibration models of marine risers using a wake oscillator approach (e.g.
  69012562, 170668193). Research in engineering materials covers analytical, computational
  and experimental work on composites and cellular materials (Akisanya, Guz, Kashtalyan,
  McMeeking, Menshykov, Menshykova, Siddiq) and on metals and alloys (Kartal, McMeeking,
  Siddiq). Composites research supported by the Royal Society, Carnegie Trust and DFG
  (Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft, Germany) has produced new analytical and numerical
  models for damage evolution and failure in polymer- and ceramics-matrix composites (e.g.
  69118794, 144858681, 114682214, 177060158). The energy absorption and deformation of
  sandwiched composite plates have been analysed (e.g. 69654300) and a new peridynamics-
  based computational framework has been developed to predict the nonlinear transient
  deformation and damage behaviour of composites under shock or blast loading (72545023)
  (DSTL, £27k, 2014-2015). Work on the mechanics of periodic cellular materials reported in
                                                                 Nature (100698035) has yielded a
                                                                 new design that achieves the highest
                                                                 possible stiffness to weight ratio for a
                                                                 low-density isotropic material. The
                                                                 Group’s research on metals and
                                                                 alloys is aimed at understanding and
                                                                 predicting material behaviour from
                                                                 nano- to macro-scale. Research
                                                                 funded by DSTL and Lloyds Register
                                                                 (£42k, 2014-2015) has led to a novel

 (EPSRC, £99k, 2014-2016) has resulted in a first-of-its-kind microstructure-based constitutive
 model that accounts for ductile damage at the scale of single crystals (97602015). Research on
 additive manufacture by selective laser melting funded by the EPSRC (£126k, 2018-2020), the
 National Structural Integrity Research Centre and The Welding Institute (NSIRC/TWI, £44k,
 2016-2019) has determined the dependence of component residual stresses on manufacturing
 process parameters (e.g. 97498049). The 400 million strain-cycle fatigue endurance limit of the
 shape memory alloy nitinol has been determined, correcting erroneous results in the literature
 and enabling the safe and reliable use of nitinol medical implants (187983068). Industry-focused
 research on materials includes work on flexible composites for coiled tubing (Research Council
 of Norway, £40k, 2016-2017), the creep behaviour of alloys for oil well plugging (OGIC, £35k,
 2016-2017) and the design of umbilical terminations for deep sea conditions (OGIC, £320k,
 2017-2020), while previous research has led to the development of a reliability-based design
 standard and guidelines for friction grip technology used for securing concentric tubulars in oil
 and gas wells (Impact Case IC3). Research in structures and geotechnics (Bagheri-Sabbagh,
 Ivanovic, Osofero, Rui) has led to new designs for lightweight and seismic-resistance cold-
 formed steel (CFS) structures and moment-resisting CFS connections (e.g. 72815205), a fully
 coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical analysis of thermo-active geo-structures (e.g. 170756769)
 and advanced finite-element models for the impact of trawl gear on the seabed (e.g. 72546128)
 (Fisheries Innovation Scotland, FIS, £94k, 2015; EU FP7, £104k, 2012-2016). Supported by the
 Lloyds Register Foundation (LRF, £1.2M, 2011-2019) the Group’s research in safety and
 reliability engineering (Omenzetter, Sriramula, Tan) extends from reliability-based optimisation
 of materials to human reliability analysis for safe operation of large infrastructure. The research
 has produced new methodologies for structural health monitoring (e.g. 105639029, 69050217),
 advanced reliability analyses applied to structures and systems (e.g. 138616650, 72523072)
 (Lloyds Register, £45k, 2014-2018; Knowledge Transfer Partnership, £179k, 2019-21) and
 human reliability analysis applied to large power systems (e.g. 106826151). Engineering
 optimisation (Dunning, Maheri, McKenna) is a new research area for the Group, predicated by
 the appointment of three academics with expertise in optimisation and systems analysis. New
 methods have been developed for topology optimisation and aeroelastic wing design (e.g.
 91870108, 107164820) and for the optimised design of hybrid renewable energy systems, which
 has changed industry practice (e.g. 94034908, Impact Case IC1). The systems analysis
 research provides stakeholder-specific decision support for multi-energy systems and the uptake
 and integration of low carbon technologies. New methods and models have been applied to real-
 world case studies to enable scientifically grounded decisions, resulting in sustainable planning
 outcomes (e.g. 177061020, 177061012). The Group’s research on decommissioning
 technologies (Ivanovic, Maheri, Neilson, Sriramula) includes development of an underwater
 laser cutting tool (OGTC-Claxton, £406k, 2019-2021), an underwater lifting system (KTP+Aubin,
 £146k, 2016-2018) and a test chamber for well plugging and abandonment materials (Scottish
 Government, £367k, 2019). Optimisation methods are being applied to cutting technologies
 (SRPe, and Clockwise Technologies, £166k, 2019-2022) and the decommissioning and
 reutilisation of offshore structures and windfarms (EU, DecomTools, £240k, 2018-2022), while
 reliability methods are being developed for post-decommissioning monitoring (Shell UK, £303k,
 2020-2022) and the fate of structures left in place (Chevron, £186k, 2020-2024).
 The Group’s strategy for the coming 5 to 7 years is to sustain a strong base of fundamental
 research in its five main areas in order to underpin applied research that will be increasingly
 geared towards renewable energy systems and infrastructure and towards the engineering
 challenges posed by the decommissioning of offshore installations. The Group will therefore play


                                                                                              Page 3

 a significant role in the University’s Energy Transition strategic research theme and play a major
 role supporting the recently established National Decommissioning Centre.
 The Chemical and Materials Engineering Research Group was a new and small group
 (3.5fte) in REF2014. With 7 new appointments, 2 of whom are ECRs, the Group has developed
 substantially since that time and now comprises 10 fte research academics. The Group
 addresses fundamental questions concerned with energy transition, decarbonisation, the circular
 economy, and sustainability. There are 4 main research areas as follows. Carbon capture and
 utilisation research (Afzal, Fernandez-Martin, Graca, Kechagiopoulos) aligns well with the UK
 Government target of net-zero carbon emissions into the atmosphere by 2050. The research
 includes the catalytic reduction of CO2 to methane, methane upgrading via plasma-catalytic
 processes, microwave-assisted carbon capture operations, and carbon-negative construction
 materials. Research on regeneration technologies for capturing post-combustion CO2 has led to
 new understanding of their potential for portable and faster carbon capture applications,
 reducing the energy penalty of the capture process by increasing the regeneration kinetics at low
 regeneration temperatures (e.g. 72260832). Research on plasma-catalytic methane upgrading
 funded by EPSRC (£140k, 2018-2020), Royal Society (£20k, 2019-2020) and the UK Catalysis
 Hub (£86k, 2016) has led to significant new understanding of the reactivity of excited states and
 the relaxation of the latter via vibrational-vibrational and vibrational-translational energy transfer
 processes (e.g. 92763139, 69604608). Research on CO2 methanation has led to new zeolite-
 based catalysts and new understanding of the optimum physicochemical properties of catalysts
 for CO2 methanation and for plasma-catalysis (e.g. 170022235). The development of new
 carbon-negative cement additives and construction materials has been supported by industry
 (Omya Chemicals, £100k, 2018-2019). The work led to a spin-out company, CCM Ltd., and was
 the basis for CCM being one of two European teams to reach the semi-final of the global
 US$20M NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE competition. Research on waste valorisation (Dionisi,
 Graca, Jiang) covers waste pre-treatment, scale-up of anaerobic digestion and thermochemical
 conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into fuels and chemicals. Research funded by the SFC,
 Carnegie Trust, Anaerobic Digestion and Food Waste networks (£300k, 2015-2019) has
 demonstrated the feasibility of converting waste into chemicals and energy, even in the absence
 of pre-treatment (e.g. 111669090); conversion greater than 50% has, for example, been
 demonstrated for wheatgrass and vegetable waste. Thermochemical conversion of
 lignocellulosic biomass residues has produced new heterogeneous catalysts for glucose
 valorisation into chemicals and new understanding of catalyst behaviour during bio-oils co-
 processing in conventional refineries and during
 biomass catalytic deconstruction (e.g. 149366339).
 Research on the production of the renewables-based
 polyethylene furandicarboxylate (PEF) has shown that
 emissions and energy consumption can be reduced by
 up to 40% compared with the production of the fossil-
 based counterpart polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
 (e.g. 170490856). Current and new research in waste
 valorisation is conducted within the Group’s
 interdisciplinary CDT in Sustainable Production of
 Chemicals and Materials funded by the Leverhulme
 Trust (£1.05M, 2018-2023), which conducts
 fundamental and applied research on new processes               Numerical simulation of mixing tank
                                                                 suspension of flexible particles
 that use renewable resources and renewable energy
 for the production of chemicals, materials and fuels that

                                                                                                Page 4

 are essential for everyday life. Research on materials for energy storage (Jiang, Martinez-
 Felipe) focuses on the development of supercapacitors and short-term and seasonal thermal
 energy storage systems. New photo-responsive materials have been designed, synthesised,
 and tested to yield new anhydrous electrolytes in fuel cells or capacitors. Using controlled living
 polymerisation methods, various random- and block-copolymers containing photochromic and
 polar groups have been synthesised, which show high conductivities at low temperatures when
 activated by light irradiation. Additionally, liquid crystalline dimers, oligomers and crosslinked
 networks that are capable of isothermal phase transitions via UV irradiation have been
 assembled by hydrogen-bonding and covalent bonds (e.g. 72520453, 72493903). Funded by the
 Royal Society, Royal Academic of Engineering, Royal Society of Chemistry and The Carnegie
 Trust (£50k, 2019-2020), the results open new possibilities for the design of materials that
 exhibit liquid crystalline chiral phases based on non-chiral molecules (e.g. 72493915). With
 applications to domestic and industrial energy utilisation, the research on thermal energy
 systems has led to improved design of hybrid thermochemical sorption cycles and novel
 composite adsorbents with enhanced heat and mass transfer and optimised thermal design.
 Process modelling and simulation (Campbell Bannerman, Derksen, Majumder) research
 covers length and time scales ranging from molecular and granular dynamics, via mesoscopic
 simulation of solid-liquid suspensions, to process-scale production of pharmaceuticals and
 cementitious materials. Molecular dynamics modelling of gases has discovered the possibility of
 “anomalous” heat transfer, which is not predictable using standard continuum mechanics
 models, and the research has mapped the range of conditions for which the phenomenon must
 occur in fluids (e.g. 143492301). Major advancements have been made in particle-resolved
 models of solid-liquid suspensions by extending model capability to include non-spherical and
 deformable particles (e.g. 114642632, 168378871, 168378821). These advanced models will be
 used to predict and optimise a range of processes, including biomass conversion of fibrous
 suspensions and battery manufacture. Population balance modelling combined with
 computational fluid dynamics has been used to optimise morphology and particle size
 distribution in the manufacture of pharmaceutical powders (e.g. 68980019). A new process-
 based predictive model has been developed for cement production, enabling the discovery and
 design of formulations for low-carbon cement (e.g. 97300481). Ongoing research in this area is
 motivated by the necessity to reduce CO2 emissions from cement production (currently
 accounting for 10% of total human CO2 emissions) and is funded by the Global Cement and
 Concrete Association (GCCA, £125k, 2019-2023) through the Nanocem project led by
 Aberdeen.
 Carbon capture and utilisation, waste valorisation and materials for energy are vital research
 areas in the context of climate change, decarbonisation, sustainability and the circular economy,
 and will continue as primary application areas for the Group’s research for the coming 5 to 7
 years. The research fits well with the University’s Energy Transition strategic research theme, to
 which the Group will make substantial contributions. The research on waste valorisation will be
 expanded to include the production of bioplastics from waste, which comes with challenges in
 terms of bioprocess and catalyst development, and the process modelling research will be
 increasingly geared towards the processability of the complex fluids and suspensions
 encountered in biomass and related conversions. Research on energy materials will focus on
 waste-based heat and the development of new electrolytes for photo-electrical energy
 conversion and supercapacitors.
 The Electrical and Electronic Engineering Research Group has expanded substantially in
 size and scope from the Power Systems, Communications and Optics Research Group

                                                                                              Page 5

 submitted to REF2014. The Group now comprises 16.2 fte research academics, with 8 new
 members since 2014, 4 of whom are ECRs. Research in digital technologies and in
 mechatronics and robotics have been added to the Group’s well-established areas of research
 strength, namely, power electronics, Internet engineering and optical engineering. Under the
 umbrella of the Aberdeen HVDC Research Centre established in 2015, research in power
 electronics (Jamshidi Far, Jovcic, Li) focuses on power electronics for grid integration of large
 renewable power parks using DC networks and high voltage direct current (HVDC). With funding
 from the EC (ERC, £588k, 2011-2014; H2020, £913k, 2016-2020), EPSRC (£458k, 2013-2016),
 SFC and ERDF (£173k, 2011-2014) and industry partners (SSE, £75k, 2013-2016; RTE France,
 £264k, 2014-2016; RTE France, £114k, 2017-2020), the research has led to new
 DC/DC converter topologies for connecting MW-sized DC power sources, new technologies for
 DC circuit breakers, and new designs, models and controls for various HVDC components that
 underpin the development of DC transmission networks (e.g. 72649636, 145094388,
 113312342, 124797756). The research enables the realisation of large-scale offshore renewable
 energy and is already changing the development strategies of major industry practitioners
 (Impact Case IC2). Internet engineering (Fairhurst, Secchi) research focusses on transport
                                                             technologies and protocol design for
                                                             the Internet and transport layers.

                                                             has led to new techniques to
                                                             significantly reduce Internet latency
                                                             (the Internet path delay experienced
   Optics alignment in the Laser Laboratory                  by applications), support network
                                                             operations, enhance transmission
 robustness and overcome obstacles to evolution (e.g. 72549936, 72469819). The work
 underpins new standards co-authored by Fairhurst (supported by EU StandICT) and published
 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which are now implemented in networking
 equipment, computer operating systems and other Internet-connected devices worldwide
 (Impact Case IC5). Research with industry (THALES, £46k, 2015-2019) and the European
 Space Agency’s ARTES programme (MTAILS, £98k, 2019-2022; QUIC, £52k, 2019) has
 contributed to Internet standards that benefit the performance of broadband satellite Internet.
 Research in optical engineering (Kaliyaperumal, Thevar) focuses on underwater holography
 and optical fibre transmission. With funding from DSTL (£126k, 2014-2017; £180k, 2019-2021)
 and the EC (H2020, €125k, 2015-2018), the group has built the world’s smallest and lightest
 pulsed digital holographic camera, including state-of-the-art rapid image extraction and
 recognition, for 3D imaging of marine organisms and microplastics. Related NERC-funded
 research (£100K, 2018-2021) combines two optical methods to image and characterise
 microplastics in the water column (e.g. 170751374). Research in optical fibre transmission
 includes higher-order linear and nonlinear effects on coherent detection, new models of ultra-
 short pulses in silicon waveguides for integrated chips used to fabricate optical systems, and the
 use of hollow-core fibres and fibre Bragg Gratings for optical sensing (e.g. 144902692,
 114687180). Mechatronics, robotics, and control (Aphale, Chadwick, Giannaccini, Meissner)
 includes precision positioning systems, model-free robotic manipulation, bioinspired and soft
 robotics, and prosthetic technologies. The research has produced several firsts in the control of
 nano-positioning systems, including a fully automated system identification and control tuning

                                                                                             Page 6

 scheme, and implementations of fractional-order positioning control (e.g. 69019115, 114449674,
 187317211). Research on model-free robotic manipulation has reduced the time needed to set
 up robotic manipulators in bin-picking and machine-loading manufacturing scenarios (e.g.
 170968486), while bio-inspired and soft robotics research has led to new fluid-actuated robot
 platforms and tactile sensors for safe human–robot interactions, object manipulation and
 healthcare applications (e.g. 149366259). In prosthetics, new computational models have been
 developed to simulate the dynamics of human hand function, enabling control of advanced hand
 prostheses for upper limb amputees (e.g. 170200426, 158961824). A similar modelling
 approach is now being used in EPSRC-funded research on technologies for spinal cord injury
 rehabilitation (EPSRC, £374k, 2018-2021). Research in digital technologies (Beecroft, Cottrill,
 Fairhurst, Nelson, Niewiadomski, Starkey, Verdicchio) was initially focused on rural digital
 economy (the Group played a major role in the University’s RCUK-funded dot.rural Digital
 Economy Hub, £11.8M, 2010-2016) but has since expanded to include data mining applications,
 sensor networks and substantial work on (human) transport technologies. Data mining is being
 applied to a range of oil and gas applications funded by OGIC and industry (Expro Ltd., £133k,
 2019-2020; WFS Technologies Ltd., £138k, 2020-2021) and OGTC and industry (Halliburton,
 £138k, 2019-2021), and a new sensor platform has been designed for environmental monitoring
 applications (e.g. 72437595). The transport research is undertaken through the Centre for
 Transport Research (CTR), which specialises in the sustainability of transport systems with
 emphasis on environment, society, and technology. With substantial funding from the EU
 (H2020 SocialCar, £287k, 2015-2018; INCLUSION, £330k, 2017-2020; CIVITAS PORTIS,
 £290k, 2016-2020; SMARTA, £72k, 2017-18), Innovate UK (£237k, 2016-2017), ESRC (£391k,
 2014-2016) and EPSRC (£776k, 2019-2021), the Centre’s achievements within the REF period
 include the development of a stackable, low-emission electric vehicle system for sustainable
 last-mile transport; analysis of the benefits from relaxing public transport operating constraints in
 rural areas; using social media data for enhanced communication between operators, authorities
 and customers; and enhanced understanding of transport barriers and solutions for vulnerable
 persons and communities (e.g. 67039515, 68947777, 171072605, 119862740).
 The Electrical and Electronic Engineering Research Group’s research in power electronics,
 Internet engineering, digital technologies and human transport will remain core to the Group’s
 research for the coming period. Power electronics will focus on DC grid components and DC grid
 design, modelling and control for offshore renewable energy development, contributing to the
 University’s Energy Transition strategic research theme. Working within ESA’s SATnex network
 of research experts, Internet engineering will focus on technologies that realise low-latency and
 high reliability for 5G/6G cellular and broadband satellite. Following recent appointments,
 research in mechatronics, robotics and control will cover a range of industrial and bioengineering
 applications, engaging with the University’s Health, Nutrition and Wellbeing strategic research
 theme.
 The Fluid Mechanics Research Group has well-established research in open channel
 hydrodynamics, wave hydrodynamics, porous media flows, eco-hydraulics and multi-physics
 flows. The Group comprises 10 fte researchers, with capacity and scope enhanced by the
 appointment of 4 new researchers (3 of whom are ECRs) bringing new expertise in waves, eco-
 hydrodynamics and multi-physics. Research in open channel hydrodynamics (Cameron,
 Nikora, Stewart) focuses on fundamental process measurements and theoretical frameworks for
 hydraulic roughness, turbulence, and secondary currents. Supported by EPSRC (£526k, 2014-
 2018), the research has led to the development and implementation of double-averaged
 equations for momentum and fluid stresses (e.g. 91895379, 170734644), new insights into bed

                                                                                                Page 7
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 friction and hydraulic resistance for rough
 beds (e.g. 170873053, 170734638), the
 discovery and characterisation of very
 large-scale motions (VLSMs) in open
 channel flows that are critically important
 for mixing, hydraulic resistance and
 sediment transport (e.g. 170815554,
 91895328), and new understanding of the
 role of turbulent velocity and pressure
 fluctuations on sediment particle
 entrainment (e.g. 170815618,
 170815613, 72336193) and of the effects
 of bed topography on secondary currents         Robotic multi-camera PIV system in the
 in channels (e.g. 170873063). The               Aberdeen Open Channel Facility
 research is founded on advanced
 measurement capability that includes a unique field stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry
 (PIV) system and the world’s first robotic multi-camera PIV, both of which were designed and
 developed by the Group within the REF period. The research on secondary currents and
 turbulence over rough boundaries has recently received further substantial external funding
 (EPSRC, 2020-2024, £735k). Research in wave hydrodynamics (Michele, O’Donoghue, van
 der A,) focuses on breaking-wave and bottom-boundary-layer hydro- and sediment dynamics,
 wave interaction with energy converters and theoretical modelling of hydroacoustic waves.
 Direct numerical simulation (DNS) combined with detailed experimental measurements has led
 to new insights and detailed datasets for turbulence in accelerating and oscillatory flows over
 smooth and rough boundaries (e.g. 129554522, 114728615, 69194492). EPSRC-funded (£606k,
 2012-2016) research has yielded a comprehensive description of hydrodynamics, turbulence
 and sediment transport processes under large breaking waves and a unique experimental
 dataset for the development and validation of numerical models for cross-shore wave processes
 (e.g. 97020960, 72336437, 174192315, 108136717). Research on wave energy converters
 using theoretical approaches to predict structure response and power extraction for various
 structure types and configurations, has shown the importance of nonlinear resonances and
 structure curvature on power absorption (e.g. 171912765, 171912753), while theoretical
 modelling of hydroacoustic waves in the ocean has demonstrated the effects of sound speed
 vertical profile on the speed of the wave-train envelope, with significant implications for tsunami
 early warning systems (e.g. 171912757). Porous media flow research (Pokrajac) focuses on
 mass and momentum transport in porous media and mass and momentum exchange at fluid-
 porous media interfaces, with application to fluvial beds (British Council, £100k, 2016-2018),
 coastal beaches (EPSRC, £214k, 2012-2016), groundwater and rock flows. The research has
 resulted in new insights into the effects of subsurface turbulence on the forces acting on
 sediment grains close to the fluid-porous interface (e.g. 148675299), advanced up-scaling
 approaches applied to multiphase flow in porous media (e.g. 186802735), and development of
 spatial averaging to address the scale mismatch between surface and subsurface flows (e.g.
 72228506). The group’s research in eco-hydraulics and flow-biota interactions (Cameron,
 Nikora, Stewart, van der A) has seen substantial expansion within the REF period, mainly
 predicated by the Group’s participation in two EC-funded MC ITN grants (HYTECH:
 Hydrodynamic transport in ecologically critical heterogeneous interfaces, €597k, 2013-2016, and
 RIBES: River flow regulation, fish behaviour and status, €300k, 2020-2023), but motivated also
 by interest in nature-based resilient solutions to climate change impacts (EC, Hydralab+, £78k,

                                                                                              Page 8
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 2015-2019). The research has produced conceptual and mathematical models for flow-plant
 interactions in unidirectional and oscillatory flows, supported by high-precision laboratory and
 field measurements (e.g. 144881543). The capability of the Group’s field stereoscopic particle
 image velocimetry system is currently being developed to support this work further (NERC,
 £289k, 2019-2020). Research on multi-physics flows (Gomes, Hicks, Zhan) includes the
 development of computational tools for multi-fluid flow dynamics, transport processes in
 biological and physiological systems, and the fluid mechanics of liquid-solid impacts with
 applications to tank sloshing, gas cushioning and droplet gas entrainment. Achievements include
 an open-source computational model with dynamic anisotropic mesh adaptivity for multiphase
 flow in porous media (e.g. 114731605) and new techniques for localised drug delivery for brain
 tumour therapy (e.g. 149070295, 170672005). The work on liquid-solid impacts has discovered
 previously unknown droplet touchdown mechanisms in low ambient pressure environments (e.g.
 114731885), yielded new insights into the effects of surface porosity on gas entrainment during
 droplet impact (e.g. 69461112) and demonstrated the importance of phase change on sloshing-
 induced LNG-solid impacts (e.g. 171365536).
 Fundamental research on free-surface flows, wave hydrodynamics and multi-physics flows will
 continue to be the primary focus of the Group for the next 5 to 7 years, expanding its application
 to renewable energy infrastructure, nature-based solutions, hydro-epidemiological processes
 and bio-engineering, areas that align well with the University’s Energy Transition and
 Environment and Biodiversity strategic research themes. A large-scale RCUK programme grant
 application on the transport and dispersion of pathogens during floods is under development
 with UCL. The application is an outcome from the EPSRC UK Fluids Network Special Interest
 Group (SIG) ‘Hydrodynamics of Open-Channel Flows’, which the Group established in 2019 and
 now leads with colleagues from UCL.
 The Petroleum Engineering Research Group is a new research group formed in 2015 in
 response to Scottish Government and industry demand for research that supports the
 development of new technologies aimed at maximising economic recovery from marginal
 hydrocarbon fields. The Group comprises 10 fte researchers, 8 of whom (1 ECR) were
 appointed since REF2014. Research across the Group has been supported by a £1M grant from
 the Scottish Government’s Oil and Gas Academy Scotland (OGAS) for research equipment. The
 research has two main themes as follows. Hydrocarbon production technologies research
 (Akanji, Hamidi, Jadhawar, Rafati, Sharifi) uses a combination of modelling and experiments to
 develop technologies for cleaner and enhanced recovery of hydrocarbons. Research within the
 REF period has been funded by OGTC (£360k, 2018-2021), OGIC (£35k, 2019), British Council
 (£159k, 2019-2021), industry (Sonangol EP, £174k, 2015-2018), The Royal Society, and through
 PhD studentships funded by the Nigerian PTDF (£400k, 2016-2018) and TETFund (£69k, 2018-
 2021). With application to ultrasonics-based enhanced oil recovery (EOR), the research has
 yielded new understanding of the effects of ultrasound on the emulsification and demulsification
 of oil and surfactant solutions (e.g. 63683451); for CO2 gas injection-based EOR, important new
 insights have been gained on the dependence of foam stability on the interaction between
 hydrocarbon solids and aqueous foam (e.g. 70449467). Motivated by the need to move from oil-
 based drilling fluids to cleaner, water-based fluids, the performance of water-based fluid
 impregnated with aluminium oxide and silica nanomaterials has been investigated under high-
 pressure, high-temperature conditions (e.g. 110721591). Modelling work includes a novel
 fracture upscaling method to represent the complex fracture systems within hydraulically
 fractured reservoirs (e.g. 183242026) and an AI-based method for selecting the most
 appropriate EOR technology depending on reservoir characteristics (e.g. 102289923). The

Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

                                            Group’s research on multi-phase flow in porous
                                            media (Syed, Tanino, Vinogradov, Wu, Zhou)
                                            addresses fundamental aspects of oil, gas, and water
                                            flow through porous rock, from pore scale to reservoir
                                            scale. Experimental research using centrifuge, core-
                                            flooding, microfluidics, scanning electron microscope
                                            (SEM) and x-ray microcomputed tomography (micro-
                                            CT) facilities has been supported by NERC (£35k,
                                            2016-2017), industry (COREX, £41k, 2015-2020;
                                            Anasuria, £24k, 2017; Total E&P, £10k, 2019), EPSRC
                                            (£21k, 2016-2018), the Royal Society and PTDF (£50k,
                                            2019-2022). It has yielded new data on the gas-water
                                            permeability of various coals (e.g. 72467617), the
                                            relationship between capillary pressure and oil relative
                                            permeability in limestone for various wettability states
                                            (e.g. 148675319), and new understanding of the effects
                                            of grain roughness on the capillary trapping of air within
                                            porous media, with potential implications for CO2
    MicroCT images of packed sand
    grains (top, 25mm diameter image)       storage, groundwater remediation and hydrocarbon
    and rock (bottom, 7.5mm image)          recovery (e.g. 171331998). The research has
                                            demonstrated, for the first time, a correlation between
 oil recovery and the zeta potential at the mineral-water and oil-water interfaces during controlled
 salinity water flooding (CSW), with significant implications for predicting the effectiveness of
 CSW for EOR (e.g. 73043609). New measurement and modelling techniques have been
 developed, including: a stochastic algorithm for pore network generation, which has been
 validated against SEM data (e.g. 187317804); a new method for recreating mineralogical
 heterogeneities in micromodels used in microfluidics (e.g. 72229849), which were previously
 limited to mineralogically homogeneous systems; and a new, mathematically well-defined
 approach to determining in-situ contact angles from micro-CT images of immiscible fluids in
 rocks (e.g. 170340936). At reservoir scale, the effectiveness of self‐potential (SP)
 measurements in monitoring saline intrusion has been demonstrated (e.g. 187318074), and a
 new numerical model has been developed to simulate flow in a confined fractured aquifer
 containing a network of discrete or connected fractures (e.g. 170340997).
 Fundamental science, artificial intelligence and new technologies applied to cleaner energy
 production and enhanced oil and gas recovery will continue as primary research areas for the
 Group for the next 5 years. Recently awarded grants for research on environmentally friendly oil-
 field chemicals and on applications of nano-particles and ultrasonics, and a new project that
 uses AI to integrate digital rock physics and Big Data to optimise oil recovery (CNOOC, £175k,
 2020-2022), are already stimulating research in these areas. The Group’s research will
 contribute to the University’s Energy Transition strategic research theme, especially through
 work on decarbonising oil and gas production, carbon storage, and development of processes
 and technologies for blue hydrogen production.
 2. People
 Staffing strategy
 A notable feature of the Unit’s submission is the number of new researchers since 2014, with 36
 fte research focused academic appointments within the REF period. This has increased the
 Unit’s size by approximately 75% and increased the Unit’s REF submission by 77% relative to

                                                                                              Page 10
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 REF2014. Academic appointments are research led - besides the 36 fte research appointments,
 only 1 teaching focused appointment was made within the REF period - and are strategically
 made to sustain and further develop areas of existing research strength, develop new research
 areas, and increase capacity for interdisciplinary research.
 Early in the REF period, the focus was on developing research capacity and expertise in
 Petroleum Engineering and in Chemical and Materials Engineering, motivated by government
 initiatives and industry demand for academic research in these areas. Within the period, six
 research academics were recruited to Chemical and Materials Engineering (Afzal, Fernandez-
 Martin, Graca, Kechagiopoulos, Majumder, Martinez-Felipe) and nine to Petroleum Engineering
 (Akanji, Hamidi, Jadhawar, Rafati, Sharifi, Syed, Vinogradov, Wu, Zhou). Recent appointments
 support the Unit’s new research in robotics and bioengineering (Chadwick, Giannaccini,
 Meissner, Zhan) and the University’s strategic research theme in Energy Transition (McKenna,
 Rui, Jiang), with senior appointments made to take leading roles in these areas (McKenna, Chair
 in Energy Transition; Chadwick, Reader in Bioengineering). At the same time, other
 appointments have been made to support areas of established research strength in applied
 dynamics (Vaziri), power engineering (Li, Jamshidi-Far), Internet engineering (Secchi) and fluid
 mechanics (Michele, Stewart).
 Staff development
 Of the 36 research-led appointments, 29 were recruited to their first academic position within the
 REF period, 12 of whom are ECRs by the REF2021 definition. The Unit supports new
 academics to establish their research as quickly as possible by allocating low teaching loads and
 giving priority in the allocation of School funded PhD studentships and School funds for new
 research equipment. Within the period, 44 fully funded PhD studentships, 5 partly funded PhD
 studentships and £406k equipment funding were allocated to new academics. In addition, the
 Unit provides fully funded PhD studentships to support successful EPSRC First Grant or New
 Investigator Award applications: 2 such applications were successful within the REF period
 (Kartal, Kechagiopoulos). All colleagues recruited to their first academic position are assigned a
 senior colleague as mentor and benefit from support from within their research group. With this
 support, 4 academics recruited within the REF period have already been promoted from Lecturer
 to Senior Lecturer (Hamidi, Kartal, Kechagiopoulos, Osofero).
 The Unit encourages and supports all academics through the research group structure, the
 research group budget, School and research group seminar series, an annual research away
 day and peer review of research grant proposals by senior academics. It operates a Research
 Enhancement Scheme (approximately £40k per annum), to which individual researchers or team
 of researchers apply for funds to support their research, and a Research Visit Scheme, which
 funds research visits to top engineering universities worldwide. Within the REF period, 12 such
 visits were funded at a total cost of approximately £50k (Akisanya to NTU, Singapore; Aphale to
 Shanghai Jiao Tong; Derksen to Princeton and to Tsinghua; Kashtalyan to Santa Barbara;
 Maheri to NTU, Singapore; Majumder to Purdue; Menshykov to McGill; Osofero to Zhejiang;
 Pokrajac to EPFL, Lausanne; Vinogradov to Monash; Wang to NUS, Singapore). The Unit also
 operates a 50-50 PhD scheme, whereby matched funding is provided for PhD studentships for
 which 50% industry funding has been secured by the academic (5 funded within the REF period)
 and has fully funded 3 PhD studentships for collaborative research with Curtin University,
 Australia. School support has been augmented by institutional support through the Principal’s
 Interdisciplinary Fund and the Principal’s Excellence Fund, which supported 23 of the Unit’s



                                                                                           Page 11

 researchers and PGR students within the period to conduct pilot research studies and attend
 conferences and networking meetings.
 Postdoctoral researchers are encouraged to apply to the University’s Research Futures Fund to
 support cross-disciplinary networking, professional development and industry engagement, and
 the institution is working towards full implementation of the new Researcher Development
 Concordat, which allocates postdoctoral researchers ten days’ professional development time
 per annum. The Unit has a track record of successfully developing the careers of its postdoctoral
 researchers: five academics appointed within the REF period were previously postdoctoral
 researchers with the Unit (Jamshidi-Far, Secchi, Stewart, van der A, Vaziri), as were eleven
 other academics included in this submission (Aleyaasin, Ivanovic, Kashtalyan, Menshykov,
 Menshykova, Neilson, Pavlovskaia, Starkey, Thevar, Verdicchio, Wiercigroch). Research-led
 promotions provide further evidence of successful staff development within the REF period: in
 addition to the four promotions of new staff to Senior Lecturer already mentioned, there were a
 further seven promotions to Senior Lecturer (Aphale, Campbell Bannerman, Dionisi, Sriramula,
 Starkey, Tanino, Thevar), two to Reader (Dionisi, Menshykov) and five to Professor (Akisanya,
 Ivanovic, Kashtalyan, Neilson, Pokrajac).
 The Unit encourages researchers to take on institutional roles that further their understanding of
 higher education policy issues and develop their leadership skills. Neilson was the University’s
 Dean for Industrial Engagement and Knowledge Exchange (2014 - 2109) and is Director of the
 National Decommissioning Centre since 2019. Guz, Ivanovic and Akisanya are members of the
 University’s Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Committee. Kashtalyan chairs the University’s
 Ethics Board for Physical Sciences and Engineering, overseeing research integrity standards
 and governance, including the biennial School governance and ethics health assessment
 process. As School Director of Research, Pokrajac is a member of the University’s Research
 Policy Committee, which oversees research strategy, policy, and performance. These
 institutional roles enable researchers to work with senior University colleagues on supporting
 and enabling research good practice, performance, and impact.
 Research students
 PhD students within the Unit are a mix of home and international students funded by the School
 of Engineering, EPSRC DTG, Carnegie Trust, industry, charities (e.g. Lloyds Register
 Foundation) and various overseas government organisations. Staff appointed within the first half
 of the REF period have been energetic in recruiting PhD students and supervising them to
 successful completion. This has led to a 78% increase in the number of PhDs awarded per
 annum over the period (14.25 fte in 2013-14, 25.35 fte in 2019-20).
 PhD students are supervised by at least two supervisors, one of whom is designated the Main
 Supervisor. Supervisor training is provided by the University’s Postgraduate Research School
 and is mandatory for all PhD student supervisors. Students are also allocated a Mentor,
 separate from the supervisory team, who takes an interest in the student’s overall progress and
 well-being and provides an additional level of student support. PhD student progress is
 assessed in the first year of study at month 7 and in the second year at month 19, involving a
 written progress report and oral examination by two assessors, who are not part of the
 supervisory team. PhD students are allocated office space, a desktop computer and £1k to
 support their research. The Unit has a dedicated Postgraduate Research Student-Staff Liaison
 Committee and PhD students themselves organise an annual 1-day PGR Symposium at which
 senior students present on their research and early-year students present posters; PhD students
 also present their work within the various seminar series organised by the research groups.

                                                                                            Page 12
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 The University’s Postgraduate Research School provides training to PhD students in a range of
 generic skills, including tutoring and demonstrating, research methods, writing and publishing,
 presenting, digital know-how, time management and well-being, impact, and enterprise. Courses
 on research ethics, data management, equality and diversity, and health and safety are
 mandatory. PhD students complete a Training and Development Plan at the outset of their PhD
 and 6-monthly Progress Review forms issued by the PGR School include reflection on the
 student’s progress against their plan.
 Equality and diversity
 The Unit is internationally diverse with 85% of submitted researchers and approximately 70% of
 PhD students originating from outside the UK. 38.8% of submitted staff have declared a BMEO
 background, which is significantly higher than the University or sector baselines (14% for
 University, 15.4% across HE sector, HESA 2018/19). 62% of submitted researchers are aged
 between 35 and 49; 45.1% are at Lecturer level. The Unit is conscious of the importance of
 supporting such a diverse community of researchers - many of whom are early-career and came
 to Aberdeen from institutions outside the UK - through the various School and University support
 mechanisms previously described.
 In common with most UK Engineering units, women representation is low: 15% of submitted
 academics and approximately 15% of PhD students are women. Increasing women
 representation is an ongoing challenge. There is however evidence that women are well
 supported within the Unit: three of the five professorial promotions within the REF period were
 women, the Unit’s Director of Research and its Director of Internationalisation are both women
 (Pokrajac and Ivanovic respectively) and Pavlovskaia is one of the Unit’s five Academic Line
 Managers, while also holding the University position of Dean of Postgraduate Taught Studies in
 Sciences, Engineering and Health Care (2016-2019). CWTS Leiden Rankings (2020) place
 Engineering & Physical Sciences at the University of Aberdeen 11th in the UK for percentage of
 papers authored by female researchers (based on papers published between 2015-2018). A full
 analysis of the Unit’s record of admitting and supporting women research students and recruiting
 and supporting women academic staff is contained in the Unit’s successful 2018 Athena SWAN
 Bronze Award submission, which also contains a detailed action plan aimed at increasing
 women representation at all levels and improving the working environment for all staff by
 embedding Athena SWAN principles within the Unit’s policies and operations.
 The Unit follows the University’s Equality and Diversity Policy in respect of all aspects of
 recruitment, promotion, development opportunities and disciplinary procedures, and all staff and
 PhD students undergo mandatory Equality and Diversity Training. Academics are also
 encouraged to attend unconscious bias training and there are a range of University groups
 available to support staff, such as the senior female network group, LGBT staff network group
 and the disability network group. The Head of the Unit (Guz) and the Unit’s Coordinator for
 Equality and Diversity (Ivanovic) are members of the University’s Equality, Diversity and
 Inclusion Committee, which oversees and progresses the advancement of equality, diversity and
 inclusion across the University. Akisanya is a member of the University’s Race Equality Strategy
 Group, whose work culminated in the University signing the Advance HE’s Race Equality
 Charter in 2020.
 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities
 Income
 The Unit’s average external research grant income is £3.5M per annum, equating to £51.2k per
 annum per fte submitted. Annual research income increased by almost 50% over the REF

                                                                                          Page 13

 period (£3.06M in 2013-14, £4.47M in 2019-20), increasing sharply within the last 2 years of the
 period as new staff established their research and successfully applied for external funding.
 Increased funding from industry and government agencies is a feature of the Unit’s funding
 portfolio: 70% of the total industry and government income was generated in the second half of
 the REF period, and the trajectory of industry funding remains upward. Industry funding is
 stimulated by University Knowledge Exchange grants, Scottish Funding Council Innovation
 vouchers and Knowledge Exchange Partnership grants (within the period, the Unit was awarded
 21 SFC innovation vouchers and 11 researchers shared a total of £125k to support innovation,
 impact and commercialisation.) EU funding remains an important source of income, particularly
 for the Electrical and Electronic Engineering (power electronics, Internet engineering and digital
 technologies) and the Fluid Mechanics Research Groups. The Unit will continue to target EU
 funding by engaging fully with Horizon Europe.
 Infrastructure and facilities
 Within the REF period there has been substantial investment (£2.3M total) in facilities and
 equipment to support the Unit’s research across the 5 research groups.
 Experimental research in Applied Mechanics is supported by materials testing, dynamics,
 structures, and geotechnics laboratories. New purchases (£95k total) within the REF period
 include a Vallen Systeme Acoustic Emission system for structure condition monitoring, new
 equipment for dynamic testing of structures, a 10 kN testing machine for natural fibre material
 characterisation and a 300 kN, 250 mm stroke actuator for large scale structural testing. Two
 micro X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanners are used to study material microstructure:
 within the REF period a new XT H 225ST Nikon CT scanner (3 µm spatial resolution, 225 kV
 maximum source) was purchased (NERC, £350k) to complement the existing ZEISS Xradia 410
 Versa machine (0.9 µm spatial resolution, 150 kV maximum source). To study damage in
 materials under load, a DEBEN CT5000 tensile and compression stage with 3- and 4-point
 bending jaws and 5kN capacity is placed directly into the ZEISS Xradia X-ray machine. The
 micro-CT facilities are also used by researchers in fluid mechanics to measure pore space
 geometry for input to numerical models of flow through porous media, by petroleum engineering
 researchers to determine formation damage and the petrophysical properties of reservoir rocks,
 and for research on combining artificial intelligence with digital rock imaging to optimise
 hydrocarbon recovery. The Unit boasts unique, high-specification facilities for its drilling
 technologies research, comprising two resonance enhanced drilling (RED) rigs, a drill-string
 dynamics rig, and a rock mechanics laboratory. The drilling rigs are capable of both resonance-
 enhanced and conventional drilling with controllable weight-on-bit (WOB), angular velocity,
 frequency and amplitude of dynamic oscillation. The drill-string rig is unique worldwide and
 reproduces the nonlinear and dangerous string motions that can occur during drilling. It provides
 controllable rotational speed and WOB, and provides measurements of angular velocities, lateral
 motions, torque-on-bit and rate of penetration. The rock mechanics laboratory was established
 within the REF period and is dedicated to experiments in which the detailed forces between a
 single cutter and rock formation are measured to give data for the validation and development of
 predictive models. The total investment in the drilling technologies research labs within the REF
 period was approximately £200k.
 New research facilities in Chemical and Materials Engineering have been established with a
 total investment of £437k within the REF period. The new facilities include an anaerobic
 digestion facility with up to ten laboratory-scale reactors to support waste valorisation research
 (£60k), a suite of hardware for measuring the performance of proton exchange membrane, direct

                                                                                            Page 14
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 methanol and solid oxide fuel cells for a wide range of temperatures and atmospheric conditions
 (£59k), and a flexiWAVE microwave synthesis reactor for research on CO2 capture (£28k). A
 new chemical reaction engineering facility comprising fully automated high temperature, high
 pressure, fixed bed reactors for the study of heterogeneous catalytic and plasma-catalytic
 reactions has been established (£140k). The facility is equipped with multiple gas
 chromatography units, one optical emission spectrometer and multiple electrical diagnostics, and
 is being used for research on natural gas (methane) upgrading and hydrogen production from
 biomass. A pilot facility was established (£150k) to demonstrate the “carbon capture machine”
 (CCM) process in which aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and aqueous solution of calcium
 chloride are combined with captured CO2 to produce precipitated calcium carbonate as product
 and sodium chloride aqueous solution as by-product. (CCM was 1 of 2 European teams to reach
 the semi-final of the global US$20M NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE competition.) Other
 investment within the REF period includes a reconfiguration of laboratory space (£300k) and
 installation of six extractor hoods (£600k) to accommodate the expansion in research.
 The Electrical and Electronic Engineering Research Group is home to substantial
 experimental facilities for its research in power electronics, Internet engineering and optical
 engineering. The Aberdeen HVDC Research Centre laboratory includes a 900V DC grid test rig
 with five 30 kW AC/DC converters. The rig incorporates two 30 kW DC/DC converters and a 30
 kW DC Hub connecting with a smaller DC grid at 200 V. This test rig has capability for live DC
 fault testing and includes open-source DC grid protection relay. As part of the recent EU project
 PROMOTioN, a state-of-the-art 5 kV - 2 kA DC Circuit Breaker test rig and multiple DC circuit
 breaker demonstrators were built. The Centre also has RTDS (Real Time Digital Simulator),
 which enables simulation of complex power systems in real time and is available at only one
 other University in Scotland. Total investment in the HVDC laboratory within the REF period was
 approximately £350k (including the RTDS at £230k). Internet Engineering facilities include a
 dedicated research networking data centre, with enterprise-grade routers, support tools and
 platforms for the execution of networking experiments, collection of results, and analysis of
 Internet measurement data. Within the REF period the research infrastructure was upgraded to
 10 Gb/s and a computing cluster was added to support virtualised networking and facilities for
 simulation (£60k). An industry equipment donation added network storage for collecting and
 archiving measurement data. The laboratory also hosts satellite and mobile testbed facilities, the
 latter via the MONROE Platform. Research in optical engineering is supported by laser research
 laboratories equipped with four vibration isolation optical tables, nine high power lasers (class 4),
 twenty lower power lasers, two high resolution spectrometers, four high resolution CMOS
 cameras and a wide range of optomechanical equipment. New investment in laser equipment
 within the REF period amounted to £70k. Following new appointments in robotics, mechatronics
 and control, the Unit is investing in a dedicated laboratory for research in this area. Existing
 equipment includes a mechanical robot arm, a 2-degree-of-freedom industrial manipulator,
 nano-positioning systems, various sensors and a swarm of mobile robots; several robotic
 manipulators and haptic interfaces are currently being procured.
 Experimental research in Fluid Mechanics is conducted within the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory,
 which houses the Aberdeen Open Channel Facility (AOCF), two 12-m open channel flumes, a
 20-m long random wave flume and the Aberdeen Oscillatory Flow Tunnel (AOFT). Other
 facilities include a porous media flow rig and a new tilting lock-exchange facility to study stratified
 shear flows. The laboratory is equipped with laser Doppler and acoustic Doppler instruments for
 fluid velocity measurements and state-of-the-art particle image velocimetry (PIV) systems. The
 Aberdeen Open Channel Facility (AOCF) is the primary research facility for research on flow

                                                                                                Page 15
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 turbulence, secondary currents, sediment dynamics, mixing, and hydraulic resistance in open
 channel flows. The facility is an 18-m long, 1.18-m wide recirculating flume, equipped with an
 instrument carriage that traverses its length, and instrumentation for precision measurement of
 flow velocities, water surface fluctuations, flow rates and bed surfaces. The highlight is a robotic
 multi-camera PIV system, designed and built in-house, which can be operated remotely in
 multiple modes. Within the REF period, the AOCF was upgraded with new pumping and control
 systems, a reconfigured flow entry and flow exit, and the addition of the robotic multi-camera
 PIV, at a cost of £250k funded by the University, EPSRC and EU research projects. The AOFT
 is a 16-m long water tunnel in which oscillatory flows with periods up to 10 s and velocity
 amplitudes up to 1.5 m/s are generated. One of the few facilities of its kind in the world, the
 facility gives exceptional capability to study wave-seabed interactions and wave-sediment
 processes at full-scale under laboratory conditions. AOFT investment within the REF period
 includes inter alia an ultrasonic 2-component velocity profiler, high-speed camera, and precision
 load cells, funded by the University, EPSRC and Lloyds Register Foundation (£65k total).
 New Petroleum Engineering laboratories have been established within the REF period to
 support this new research group. With £655k investment, the facilities include four core-flood
 rigs; two lab-on-a-chip stations with micromodels for dynamic visualisation of pore-scale
 multiphase flow; a unique multi-purpose EOR test facility that allows easy switching between
 different EOR technologies; an ultrasonics facility for investigating ultrasound-based technology
 applied to various downhole issues such as scale removal, formation damage reduction and
 condensate banking stimulation; a high pressure, high temperature (HPHT) triaxial cell with
 beamline measurements for 3D images of evolving fractures; and a facility for HPHT anaerobic
 cultivation of microbes that produce biosurfactants, which reduce interfacial tension for EOR
 purposes.
 In addition to the above, a further £4.8M is being invested in facilities to support NDC related
 research. This includes a 15-kW laser and a real-time, real physics marine simulator for trialling
 offshore operations in virtual environments. It also includes a substantial contribution (£440k) to
 the £750k total investment over the REF period in enhancing the institution’s high performance
 computing facility (Maxwell), which now comprises 1240 CPU cores, 12 TB of RAM, several
 specialist nodes (one with 3TB of memory), and more than 1 Petabyte of tiered storage,
 including 15TB of very high-performance storage.
 The Unit’s research is supported by 17 fte technicians based in the Unit’s research laboratories
 and workshops.
 University Support for Research
 The University’s Research and Innovation office (R&I) provides dedicated support for research
 costing, contracts, engagement with industry, research commercialisation and advice on
 research governance and policy. Through its Grants Academy Programme, R&I provides pump-
 priming funds for new research ideas, and advice and training on identifying research
 opportunities, applying for external funding, public engagement and achieving impact. For
 example, within the assessment period, pump-priming funds were awarded to Fernandez-Martin,
 Dionisi and Martinez-Felipe to explore the production of bioenergy and smart materials from
 palm tree waste in Malaysia, which resulted in a £225k International Collaboration Award in
 2017, and impact-related funding was provided to Nelson, Fairhurst, Jovcic and Maheri to help
 realise the impact of their research on intelligent mobility, internet standards, HVDC
 technologies, and optimisation of hybrid renewable energy systems respectively (supporting the
 development of Impact Cases IC6, IC5, IC2, IC1). R&I also supports researchers with patent

                                                                                              Page 16

 filing and intellectual property. Four patent families from the Unit were approved within the
 assessment period (three relating to DC convertor design and one on nano-control of robotic
 movement) and two spin-out companies were created: Carbon Capture Machine (UK) Ltd,
 concerned with converting carbon dioxide into carbonates for use in cements and other
 products, and iVDrill Ltd, concerned with commercialising the various drilling technologies
 developed from the Unit’s research in applied dynamics.
 Open Research
 The Unit meets its open access obligations with support from the Scholarly Communications
 Unit based in the University Library. In REF 2014, 26% of the Unit’s journal articles were publicly
 accessible from the point of publication; open access compliance is now (2020) 79% across all
 journal articles and exceeds 90% for journal articles that are based on funded research. Open
 data is supported by the University’s data management policy, which encourages and provides
 training in the use of data management plans, and by the University Library who ensure the
 correct metadata is present and appropriate copyright licences are selected. The Unit complies
 with EPSRC’s and other funders’ open data mandate. Fourteen datasets from the Unit are
 currently publicly available from the University’s repository, which supports direct uploads as well
 as DOIs or web links that connect to other repositories, such as Figshare and Mendeley. The
 Unit’s research facilities are available to academic and industry users through
 https://equipment.data.ac.uk/ and https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/equipments/.
 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society
 Collaborations, networks, and partnerships
 The Unit recognises that excellent engineering research is conducted collaboratively. For this
 reason, the Unit encourages internal collaboration through research group activities and external
 collaboration by inviting external speakers to speak at the School Seminar Series (18 within the
 REF period) and Distinguished Lecture Series (10 within the period), and funding research visits
 to top institutions worldwide via its Research Visit Scheme. All submitted researchers are
 engaged in collaborative research in various ways, evidence of which is seen in the Unit’s
 collaborative funding and in its outputs: data from Web of Science shows that, for the period
 2014 to 2020, 64% of the Unit’s total outputs have at least one international co-author. The
 Unit’s collaborations and partnerships vary in scale from a few academics collaborating on a
 specific research problem to large-scale projects involving many partners addressing a major
 research challenge. The former are too numerous to detail here, but notable examples include:
 Derksen’s research on the fluid dynamics of mixing with Princeton University (114642632);
 Kashtalyan’s work with the University of Seville on composites modelling (144858681);
 McMeeking’s collaboration with the University of Virginia on cellular materials, which led to a
 Nature paper (100698035); Pokrajac’s collaboration with the Technical University of Milan on
 sediment transport modelling (164251112); Sriramula’s collaboration with Oxford on multi-scale
 stochastic mechanics applied to composites (138616650); and Zhan’s work with the National
 University of Singapore and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine on the design of drug delivery
 systems for brain cancer treatment (170672408). Collaborations of this kind contribute
 significantly to the overall vitality of research within the Unit and can lead to substantial
 externally funded research projects. Examples include Nikora’s research on bed friction in
 rough-bed free-surface flows with Cardiff University (EPSRC, £526k, 2014-2018) and on
 secondary currents with UCL, Glasgow and Southampton Universities (EPSRC, £735k, 2020-
 2024), O’Donoghue and van der A’s work on breaking and irregular wave hydrodynamics with
 the Universities of Liverpool and Twente (EPSRC, £606k, 2012-2016) and Jovcic’s work on DC


                                                                                             Page 17
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 networks with Strathclyde, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Huazhong University of Science
 and Technology (EPSRC, £735k, 2013-2016).
 The Unit’s larger-scale collaborations mainly occur within EU research projects, doctoral training
 centres and industry focused research programmes. The Unit collaborates extensively with
 European researchers through EU partnerships and projects (16 within the REF period), typically
 involving multi-disciplinary teams from several universities, research institutes, industry, and
 stakeholder partners. Highlight collaborative projects of this type include the International
 Training Networks (EU-MC-ITN) HYTECH (Hydrodynamic transport in ecologically critical
 heterogeneous interfaces, 2013-2016) and RIBES (River flow regulation, fish behaviour and
 status, 2020-2023), and PROMOTioN (2016-2020), which is H2020’s largest energy research
 project with 33 partners addressing the technical, legal, regulatory, economic and financial
 barriers to the implementation of a HVDC transmission network in the North Sea. Other
 examples include HYDRALAB+ Adapting to Climate Change (2015-2019), involving a network of
 24 institutes developing improved hydraulic modelling approaches to address climate change
 scenarios, and DecomTools (2018-2022) involving 12 partners developing new technologies to
 reduce the costs and environmental impact of decommissioning offshore wind energy
 infrastructure. The Unit also participates in the 22-partner European Satellite Network of Experts
 (SatNEx) funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), which explores new research directions
 for satellite telecom networks for possible inclusion in ESA’s R&D programme.
 The Unit has developed a strong partnership with the Scottish Government’s OGTC and OGIC
 centres, with 16 OGTC/OGIC-industry research projects with a total value of £3.6M within the
 REF period. Launched in 2019, the National Decommissioning Centre (NDC) is a partnership
 between OGTC and the University of Aberdeen, with OGTC contributing £12.7M towards
 operational and infrastructure costs and the University contributing £5M through provision of
 buildings, staff time and fee waivers. An additional £4.8M was secured through the Scottish
 Government’s Decommissioning Challenge Fund for facilities to support NDC research. Several
 NDC-funded PhD projects are underway and two major industry-funded research projects have
 recently been awarded (Chevron, £186k, 2020-2024; Shell, £303k, 2020-2022). RTE (Réseau
 de Transport d'Électricité), the largest transmission system operator in EU, is an important
 industry partner for the Unit’s research in power electronics and has funded and collaborated on
 three major research projects related to DC transmission systems. The Unit also partners with
 industry through Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (5 KTPs within the period) and the provision
 of several CPD courses for upskilling professional engineers working in decommissioning and
 energy transition. Neilson was a member of the Steering Group for the North East of Scotland
 KTP Centre (2017–2019).
 The Unit is alert to opportunities for collaboration and partnerships with other disciplines within
 the University of Aberdeen. The Unit’s Chemical and Materials Engineering Research Group
 leads the cross disciplinary Leverhulme Centre for Doctoral Training in Sustainable Production
 of Chemicals and Materials (£1.05M, 2018-2023). This is a collaboration between the Unit and
 the University’s Schools of Biological Sciences, Social Sciences, Medicine, and Natural and
 Computing Sciences, aimed at providing doctoral training and research in new technologies for
 the sustainable production of chemicals and materials from organic waste and renewable
 resources. The Unit’s Centre for Transport Research leads cross-disciplinary research involving
 engineers, geographers, psychologists, sociologists, economists and computing scientists - as
 well as partnerships with European researchers, government policymakers and industry - on the
 sustainability of transport systems with emphasis on environment, society and technology.

 sediment transport, turbulence structure, and alluvial river mechanics” and the IAHR 7th M.
 Selim Yalin Lifetime Achievement Award (2019) for “experimental, theoretical or numerical
 research that has resulted in significant and enduring contributions to the understanding of the
 physics of phenomena and/or processes in hydraulic science or engineering”.
 Contributions to economy and society
 The Unit’s contributions to economy and society range from the design of engineering
 components that enhance the competitiveness of UK industry, to taking a leading role in
 addressing new challenges of profound national societal and economic importance. An example
 of the former is the Unit’s research on a novel friction-grip technology for oil and gas casing
 hangers that led to the technology being used in nearly one-third of the approximately 120,000
 hangers used in oil and gas operations worldwide. The stand-out example of the latter is the
 Unit’s role in establishing and leading (Neilson) the National Decommissioning Centre, bringing
 industry and academic expertise together to address the engineering, environmental, economic
 and legal challenges associated with decommissioning or reusing the estimated 100 offshore
 platforms and 5700 km of subsea pipeline that will become redundant on the UK Continental
 Shelf (UKCS) over the coming decade. Action 3 of the Government Response to the Call for
 Evidence on “strengthening the UK’s offshore oil and gas decommissioning industry” (2020)
 calls on the Decommissioning Task Force, OGTC and the NDC to develop a plan with regulators
 and industry for developing new technology and solutions for decommissioning, aimed at
 achieving the regulator’s (Oil and Gas Authority) 35% target reduction on the estimated starting-
 point cost to the taxpayer of £59bn.
 The energy sector’s shift from fossil-based sources of energy to renewable sources has
 profound economic, environmental, and societal impact. Energy transition related research


                                                                                           Page 20
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 features strongly in the activities and strategies of each of the Unit’s research groups.
 Contributions with notable impact already achieved include HVDC technologies that are
 changing industry’s approach to the design of offshore renewable power transmission to enable
 large-scale expansion of offshore wind energy, and new tools for optimising the design of hybrid

 The Unit’s Internet engineering research has contributed new analyses, protocols, algorithms
 and architectural design to Internet Standards published by the Internet Engineering Task Force
 (IETF) and published 11 specifications in the Requests for Comments (RFC) series. These
 documents underpin Internet operation globally and are embedded within technology products
 that support the economy and society in numerous ways. An example application is Intelligent
 Mobility (IM), whereby data and technologies are used to connect people, places, and products
 across all transport modalities, and which is expected to have a global market worth £900 billion
 by 2025 (Transport Systems Catapult). The Unit’s Centre for Transport Research is a
 recognised thought-leader in IM, particularly focused on applying technologies for more efficient,
 equitable and sustainable practices to complete end-to-end journeys, and developing shared
 mobility models to enhance transport services for under-served populations in peri-urban and
 rural environments. This research has contributed to increased government and industry interest
 in Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), with the travelling public and wider society being the ultimate
 beneficiaries.
