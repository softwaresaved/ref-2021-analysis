    1. Unit (and Institutional) context and structure, research and impact strategy

 1.1: Institutional Context and Structure
 The Glasgow School of Art (GSA) is Scotland’s only independent institution for education in Art,
 Design & Architecture. Founded in 1845, it is one of the largest specialist research communities
 in Scotland and was one of the first government Schools of Design, combining Glasgow’s
 industrial and creative heritage and built on the intellectual traditions of reason and humanism
 rooted in the Scottish Enlightenment. Our enduring core purpose is to innovate and develop
 creative, critical and practical skills, new knowledge and insights in support of current and future
 generations of students, creative practitioners and researchers. In the 21st century, our purpose
 includes: the integration of new and emerging ideas, materials and digital technologies with our
 established creative practices to meet the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals
 (UN2030 SDGs).

 Since REF2014 GSA has seen growth in student numbers and a change in student
 demographic, due to a targeted increase in postgraduate taught (PGT) and postgraduate
 research (PGR) students. There have also been significant changes to GSA’s leadership. Tom
 Inns was Director from 2013 until 2018, Irene McAra-McWilliam was Interim Director (2018-
 2020) and our current Director, Penny Macbeth, joined in May 2020. McAra-McWilliam then
 became Deputy Director of Research and Innovation and in December 2020 Allan Atlee joined
 as Deputy Director (Academic).

 1.1b Fires and a Pandemic:
 Since REF2014, GSA has experienced a sequence of unforeseeable impediments. Two major
 fires in 2014 and 2018 destroyed much of the iconic Charles Rennie Mackintosh Art School
 building including its library, gallery, teaching spaces for Fine Art and parts of our archives and
 collections. These events derailed strategic plans and initiatives for research that were then
 further stalled by the outbreak of COVID-19 in the UK in March 2020. Diverting our strategic and
 operational focus to crisis management at each of these three points over the current REF cycle
 has adversely impacted our individual researchers, research infrastructure, resources and the
 academic estate. Specifically, these events have delayed: development for new staff and early
 career researchers (ECRs); the development of civic, business and policy partnerships; and our
 submission to Athena SWAN. Mitigating circumstances were submitted concerning the fires and
 a reduction in outputs was granted.

 Institutional recovery following the 2014 fire resulted in a simplified management structure and
 strategic plan, focused on growth, sustainability and diversification of the portfolio. Following the
 2018 fire (significantly worse than the first and destroying the extensive post-2014 restoration
 work), our strategy was readjusted to focus on core operational goals. Although challenging,
 GSA’s role as a vital part of Glasgow’s creative and cultural infrastructure has enabled us to
 manage our key operations and to contribute to Scotland’s creative economy and its COVID-19
 recovery plan (see ICS 4 Health and Care Services). These three unprecedented events have
 strengthened our organisational resilience.

 1.1c GSA Key Developments 2014 – 2020:
 i. Academic Restructuring (2015-16)
 ii. Strengthening Scholarly Support (2016-2018)
 iii. Building Strategic Partnerships (2014-)

 i. Academic Restructuring
 In 2016 two new schools, the Innovation School (IS) and the School of Simulation and
 Visualisation (SimVis), were formed to extend our academic portfolio. In 2015, Historical and
 Critical Studies were subsumed within the relevant schools to increase the integration of
 history, theory and practice and to strengthen scholarship. The formation of the Innovation
 School was underpinned by the 2016 launch of GSA’s Highlands and Islands campus on the
 Altyre Estate near Forres, which focuses on Design Innovation PGT and PGR provision.
 Consolidation of doctoral studies training and funding was enabled by membership of the
 Scottish Graduate School for Arts & Humanities (SGSAH, 2014-present) and the appointment of
 a Head of Doctoral Studies (Thompson) in 2017. Our strategic plans were revised to distinguish
 established research strengths and their potential for impact, from strengths in innovation,
 knowledge exchange (KE) and enterprise and to identify emerging subject areas (e.g. AR/VR
 heritage visualisation) requiring targeted support. The role of the R&E Dept (formerly Research
 and Doctoral Studies) was also reviewed to provide effective support for academic leaders
 across our five schools. Its key roles are to:
     • distil and disseminate sector-wide research intelligence and opportunities
     • oversee research integrity, governance and ethics
     • manage research and enterprise data, open research and co-ordinate submission to
         REF, using our bespoke Repository of Art, Design and Architecture Research (RADAR)
     • support funding applications and conduct annual quality monitoring for R&E
     • increase capability and capacity provision for research and career development support
     • facilitate and manage EDI and coordinate data for submission to Athena SWAN and
         Race Equality Charter (See Section 2 People)
     • oversee, manage and develop Doctoral Studies.

 Our new school structure clarified our research strengths in the fields of architectural and design
 history, socially engaged arts practice, environmental architecture and design for health and
 care. Conversely, it identified gaps in research support including the need to: 1) facilitate
 dialogue across GSA and build capability, capacity and leadership in new and emerging
 interdisciplinary fields; and 2) identify, systematise and strengthen complementary research and
 KE partnerships to enable integrated response to the UN2030 SDGs and to our civic, national
 and global challenges.

 ii) Strengthening Scholarly Support
 The 2014 fire highlighted the distinctive role our heritage, archives and collections play in
 GSA’s research and teaching and, increasingly, in developing exhibitions and stimulating public
 engagement and KE. Building on the success of previous history and heritage projects (e.g. The
 Glasgow Miracle, 2012-2013, AHRC £122,500, now a permanent part of the ‘Third Eye Archive’
 at Glasgow’s Centre for Contemporary Art), in 2018 we took the strategic decision to accelerate
 the digitisation of our archives and collections. By Dec 2020, we had digitised 1,000+ 3D objects
 and over 60,000 2D items.

 iii) Building Strategic Partnerships
 A milestone in our establishment of strategic long-term partnerships was the launch of the Digital
 Health & Care Innovation Centre (DHI) in partnership with the University of Strathclyde (awarded
 in late 2013, with University of Edinburgh as the initial partner), one of seven Scottish Funding
 Council (SFC) Innovation Centres. Drawing on GSA’s established research expertise in Design
 for Health & Care and Digital Visualisation, DHI works with healthcare providers, SMEs, charities
 and other key stakeholders to develop new service models, delivery pathways and digital
 solutions for healthcare across Scotland. Its success is demonstrated through receipt of
 continued funding (2017-2024) from the Scot Gov Health & Care Directorate (i.e. NHS
 Scotland) alongside SFC (ICS 4 Health and Care Services). For 2013-2024, DHI has received
 £20.5m of Scot Gov funding (£7.68m to GSA).

 Our longstanding research strengths in sustainable and urban design and development are
 evident in GSA’s Glasgow Urban Lab (GUL), funded in partnership with Glasgow City Council
 (£30k per annum). In 2017, GUL was established as a United Nations Centre of Excellence and
 subsequently conducted a comparative research study, ‘Scotland’s Urban Age’ (2018),
 sponsored by the Chambers of Commerce in Aberdeen, Glasgow & Edinburgh and the Law firm
 Burness Paull, and focused on understanding the concentration and growth drivers of Scotland’s
 key cities in terms of policy, economics and strategic digital and physical infrastructures, and
 how these may address ageing, migration, climate change and employment. In 2019, GUL’s
 Director, Evans, was appointed the UK’s first City Urbanist by Glasgow City Council.

    1.2 Institutional Research & Impact Strategy

 1.2a Research Development 2014 – 2021
 In REF2014, GSA outlined six key objectives for 2021: 1) Develop thought leadership in key
 areas of research strength; 2) Develop a reputation for expertise and policy development; 3)
 Develop sustainable international research centres; 4) Be recognised for interdisciplinary
 research and KE; 5) Become an institution of choice and attract academic staff and PGR
 students of the highest quality; 6) Have extended strategic partnerships in all sectors.

 Despite setbacks, we have achieved the majority of our 2014 objectives. Interdisciplinary subject
 expertise, thought leadership, strategic partnerships and policy development are notable in our
 leading research centres: 1) Health & Care, with the work of DHI and with Macdonald’s
 research being recognised with the inaugural AHRC/Wellcome Health Humanities ‘best research
 award (2018); 2) Sustainable and Healthy Environments, with MEARU’s research on Indoor
 Air Quality (ICS 1 Improving Indoor Air Quality); and Urban and Economic Policy and
 Development, with Evans’ research on Scotland’s major cities and his role as Chief Consultant
 for UN’s Habitat III report (Evans, 6606).

 PGR growth has resulted through our active partnership in the SFC/AHRC funded SGSAH and
 developments in our support infrastructure. Since 2014, GSA has seen a 160% increase in
 new UKRI-funded doctoral awards, 90% growth in UKRI PGR funding, 71% increase in doctoral
 enrolments and 100% increase in doctoral completions.

 1.2b Interdisciplinary Research
 As a Small Specialist Institution (SSI), GSA has an imperative to build partnerships and a long
 track-record of developing and contributing to interdisciplinary research e.g. through design (ICS
 4 Health & Care Services), in environmental architecture (Foster 4595) and in SimVis’s digital
 heritage work e.g. Jeffrey’s role as a Co-Director of One Ocean Hub (OOH) a £20M UKRI GCRF
 Global Research Hub in collaboration with University of Strathclyde and international partners
 including Rhodes University and University of South Pacific.

 To enhance school-based disciplinary research, we have developed four complementary
 interdisciplinary research themes which build on our existing strengths, harvest learning across
 schools and identify opportunities for new strategic partnerships. The themes are formed from
 an evidence base of high-quality research, external funding and a critical mass of researchers
 and PGRs. Reduced from the 10 themes outlined in REF2014, instrumental in shaping GSA’s
 interdisciplinary research, and aligned with the UN2030 SDGs, our four new themes are:

        1. Sustainable Environment and Economies
           SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy); SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities)
           SDG 13 (Climate Action); SDG 14 (Life Below Water)
        2. Cultural Landscape & Identity
           SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities); SDG 15 (Life on Land); SDG 16 (Peace, Justice &
           Strong Institutions)
        3. History, Heritage, Archives & Collections
           SDG 5 (Gender Equalities); SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities);
        4. Health and Care
           SDG 3 (Good Health & Wellbeing); SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure)

Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 This theme includes: MEARU’s work on low energy design and building performance; GUL’s
 research addressing the ecological, social and economic sustainability of Scotland’s key cities;
 Jeffrey’s leadership of OOH; research on the creative economies of the Scottish Islands
 (McHattie, 6972); and research that interrogates social justice issues and inequalities (Birrell,
 7529; Smith, 4820). Both MEARU and GUL maintain strategic associations with Glasgow’s
 governance and with Scottish and UK policy makers and built environment professions to ensure
 their research is impactful in shaping environmental and urban policies across Scotland and
 internationally. Of particular note is Evans’ membership of the United Nations Economic
 Commission for Europe (UNECE) and his AGE report which has provided key information for the
 new National Planning Framework (NPF4) being prepared by the Scottish Government under
 the Planning (Scotland) Act 2019.

 This theme includes international projects that have refined distinctive individual research
 methodologies and attracted significant investment (Cooper, 7135; McBride, 4870) as well as
 local projects working, for example, with Scottish communities in post-industrial towns (Bird,
 7526). This expanded theme embraces the Reading Landscapes group (2014-) located in the
 School of Fine Art. Contested social and political landscapes, migration, forced human
 displacement and explorations of self are also explored in this theme (Birrell 7528; Brind 7536;
 Tripp, 7535, McAra, 7382). Another body of research is positioned at the intersection of this
 theme and ‘Sustainable Environments’ (above), exemplified by: Greated’s (7534) explorations of
 the visual pollution of Scotland’s renewable energy generators; Thomson’s (7530) exploration of
 the Scots language in relation to Highland flora and fauna; and Robertson’s (3789; 5886) design
 history studies of Highland power stations.

 Researchers in this grouping have drawn extensively on archives and collections (including
 GSA’s) to unlock new knowledge on diverse subjects, such as: Scotland’s textile design heritage
 (Britt 7531); art historical narratives of Afro-Caribbean artists and designers in Scotland (Boyle,
 7537); and feminist perspectives on museum collections (McMullan, 7538). Research in this field
 also includes the collaborative conservation of archaeological heritage assets (Jeffrey, 4758;
 5224); and lone scholars working independently on public heritage in the form of architectural
 taxonomies, monuments and post-war street furniture (Urban, 5776; Rodger, 3886; Herring
 3862) and Scandinavian shipbuilding (Peter, 5608), as presented in ICS 3, Maritime Design
 History.

 Strategic scholarly networks and partnerships have been vital enablers to GSA’s success in this
 field. The Centre for Digital Documentation and Visualisation (CDDV), a joint venture established
 with Historic Environment Scotland (HES) and CyArk (USA) as partners (2010 - 2021), produced
 the Scottish Ten (ICS 1, REF2014) and has supported HES’s digital visualisation leading to the
 2017 launch of the National Heritage Building Conservation Centre (NHBCC) as part of the
 Engine Shed in Stirling and concluding the transition of HES to a non-departmental government
 body (NDPB) with IRO status.

 Led by Macdonald since 1995, our research in health and care is characterised by an
 interdisciplinary team-based approach, deploying co-design methods in clinical and community
 settings and focusing on the user experience (patient, carer, clinician) throughout the healthcare
 ecosystem (Macdonald, 7417; Macduff, 7215; Teal, 7456; French, 7451), leading to the
 successful launch of the DHI. Of particular note is GSA’s contribution to the AHRC-led, cross-
 Council Anti-Microbial Resistance Programme (2017-20). Of the 11 funded projects, GSA led on
 three and provided the Co-Investigator to a fourth.

 The 3D Head and Neck (2013) developed by SimVis led to the 3D Definitive Human (2014-
 2019), a new highly accurate interactive model of an entire human anatomy with extended reality
 interfaces. Launched in 2019 as an open-access educational tool primarily for use in medical
 education and training contexts, it was funded by SFC, RCSEd and NHS Education Scotland
 (NES) with in-kind support from the University of Glasgow and the Fulbright Commission (total
 funding received: £1,057,000, 2013-2020).

 1.2c GSA’s Future Research Strategy
 We will continue to accelerate our recovery, encourage risk taking, support new and ambitious
 ideas and commit to academic and research development to enhance performance at all career
 stages. Following a challenging period, our strategic objectives for 2021-27 place people at the
 centre.

 1. PEOPLE
 Review our academic career framework integrating appropriate principles and actions from the
 UKRI Researcher Development Concordat (2019) and VITAE’s Researcher Development
 Framework (RDF). We will:
 1.a Review the role of research, impact, KE and enterprise to enhance academic careers,
 improve workload planning and work/life balance
 1.b Develop GSA’s research leadership through training and peer-to-peer mentoring
 1.c. Enhance Research Integrity by reviewing the governance, management and monitoring of
 research and KE and ensure that ethics and EDI are integral all GSA’s policies and practices.

 2.INFRASTRUCTURE
 Strengthen our digital infrastructure and information management for capturing research, impact
 and KE to improve resilience, sustainability, transparency and reporting. We will:
 2a. Continue to development RADAR and Open Research to showcase all modes of arts and
 humanities research in discoverable digital form and support the profiling of GSA’s researchers
 and PGR students
 2.b. Review the learning from COVID-19 and establish leadership and processes to accelerate
 GSA’s EDI actions and achieve Athena SWAN and Race Equality Charter recognition (aligning
 to UN2030 equalities SDGs).

 3. RESEARCH BASE, IMPACT & KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE
 Continue to consolidate of our academic infrastructure and support for research, impact and KE,
 including growing GSA’s portfolio of interdisciplinary research skills, systematic peer support and
 develop opportunities for research dissemination and pathways to impact. We will:
 3.a. Continue to diversify sources of funding and increase grant applications, research and KE
 income
 3.b. Develop skills, knowledge and methods to capture impact within GSA and with our strategic
 partners


                                                                                              Page 6
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 3.c. Contribute to thought leadership, to internationalising our research and to sector innovation
 professionally and academically.

 4. PARTNERSHIPS
 Continue to strengthen GSA’s strategic partnerships, identify pathways to increasing impact
 through KE, Knowledge Transfer, Enterprise and cultural engagement. We will:
 4.a. Increase policy alliances to extend GSA’s research and strengthen impact in the public,
 private and community sectors
 4.b. Develop GSA’s strategic use of its civic presence, physical and digital resources to stimulate
 and increase outreach and public engagement.

 1.2d Impact Strategy

 Approach to Impact
 Since 2014, we have developed an integrated approach to supporting, monitoring and managing
 impact through our R&E Dept. As recipients of SFC ‘s Universities Innovation Fund (UIF), we are
 committed to delivering seven national outcomes for Scotland, aligned to economic and social
 impact, including stimulating business demand, innovation and commercialisation, increasing
 social impact, social justice, diversity and inclusivity. Relationships with our users, beneficiaries
 and audiences are increasingly aligned to our interdisciplinary groupings enabling us to support
 diverse types of impact that respond effectively to our subject portfolio. These include the
 successful development of strategic relationships with NHS Scotland, Historic Environment
 Scotland and the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) and cultural partners,
 including the Edinburgh Art Festival, the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Art and and Eureka!: The
 National Children’s Museum. Our collective impact has changed policies and practices in health
 and care (ICS 4) and the built environment (ICS 1), created employment and increased
 economic benefit for health, public, private and cultural sectors (ICS 4, 2 and 3) and stimulated
 public imagination in relation to the political and social issues of global importance (ICS 2).

 Support for Impact
 Since 2014 we have established a clearer distinction between, research, impact and KE,
 enabling us to more effectively target our investment and identify future developments. This
 included: a 0.5 FTE investment in a new dedicated professional support role for impact as part of
 a full-time post (Research Development and Impact Officer, 2020-present). Staff can apply for
 targeted financial support for impact via our REG-funded Research Development Impact
 Fund. Since 2014 we have made 36 RDF Impact awards for diverse projects (totalling £76,831)
 e.g. support for participation in RCPCH/Royal College of Physicians’ ‘Effects of Indoor Air on
 Children’s Health Across the Lifecourse’ awareness-raising initiative (ICS 1); and prototyping a
 digital printing process for cashmere textiles.

 Impact investment also includes five KTPs, involvement in 12 Innovate-UK projects and 5 AHRC
 Follow-On funding projects, focusing on health and care, energy efficient buildings, digital
 visualisation and rural economic, creative and community development in the Highlands and
 Islands. The latter were enabled by the Creative Futures Partnership, a significant programme of
 impact, KE and innovation support in partnership with Highlands and Islands Enterprise (2014-
 19), linked to the creation of our rural campus at Altyre. This wide-ranging initiative supported a
 series of impact activities for regional development, including support for creative SMEs and
 makers, community-led development, innovative approaches to health and wellbeing in remote
 locations and projects focused on sustainability and the circular economy.

 GSA has also, where possible, negotiated secondment opportunities for researchers in health,
 creative or business settings to develop and realise the KE and impact potential of their research
 e.g. Poyade has collaborated on two R&D projects with autism charity Friendly Access and
 design agency Crag3D to develop therapeutic VR applications for people with hidden disabilities
 (2017-20); and French, was given leave of absence to work with Scottish Care and to apply the
 outcomes of her research in practice (2019-21).

 Future Support for Impact
 The consolidation of our academic and support structures and the development of our
 interdisciplinary themes enabled us to identify the four submitted ICS and to target potential
 areas for growth and investment (2021-27) including: art, design and architecture history;
 heritage; socially engaged art practice; and visual simulation.

 Case Study Approaches
 Our four submitted ICS have received support and funding to facilitate impact development since
 2014. ICS 1 (Indoor Air Quality) is drawn from the extensive body of environmental design
 research systematically developed by MEARU since its founding in 1986. Supported by UIF, 5
 KTPs, Innovate UK funding and professional and international networks it has shaped Scottish
 environmental and housing construction policy. ICS 4 (Health & Care Services) has emerged
 from recognised design research strengths leading to the DHI, which demonstrates the
 importance of sustained strategic dialogue with external partners in producing and applying
 research in health and care environments. ICS 3 (Maritime Design History and Modern
 Shipping) focuses on ways that Peter’s research on the design history and material culture of
 cruise ships and Ro-Ro ferries has been deployed directly by the shipping industry in the
 promotion and development of business and by international cultural organisations to enhance
 public understandings of this history. ICS 2 (Refugee Crisis and Arts Practice) demonstrates
 the ability of collaborative curatorial and arts practice to engage international public audiences
 with the global refugee crisis. Collectively these studies reflect our interdisciplinary themes and
 reveal the diversity of our research and its impacts; from influencing areas of policy and public
 services to enhancing and changing business and industry practices.

 Research Integrity
 GSA fully supports and is compliant with the principles of the Concordat to Support Research
 Integrity. Although not a formal signatory, our research governance, codes of practice,
 procedures and research ethics policies were revised in 2016 to align with the Concordat. Our
 rigorous Research Ethics Policy, Research Ethics Code of Practice and Research Data
 Management Policy and Records Management Policy ensure high standards throughout our
 research portfolio. All research undertaken at GSA must apply for formal ethical approval, a
 process managed by our R&E Dept. As a member of Vitae, GSA actively promotes its
 Researcher Development Framework (RDF) to encourage best practice for the knowledge,
 behaviour and attributes of successful researchers. In addition, an online module on research
 integrity is offered through our VLE, provided by University of Dundee. Our annual research
 monitoring also reviews and reports on research integrity through the GSA committee structure
 (see Section 3.2a).

 Open Research Environment
 GSA has prioritised investment and continued to develop its Open Research environment
 (RADAR) since REF2014, with emphasis on the presentation of practice-based research and the
 discovery and dissemination of datasets as well as outputs. We are working towards full
 compliance with the Concordat on Open Research Data, underpinned by a series of policies,
 processes and communication strategies: Open Access; Research Data Management; and the
 Research and Enterprise Privacy Notice. RADAR is monitored regularly for compliance. The
 dedicated RADAR team (2 FTE) provide regular OA and data-related advice to researchers, new
 staff and PhD students through a range of support materials and platforms.

 2. People
 Our collective focus on accelerated recovery in this period has placed people at the centre of our
 R&E planning, which has included the embedding of annual research planning to protect staff
 time for research, building our research communities, stimulating interdisciplinary dialogues,
 sustaining research production, expanding opportunities to develop impact and supporting our
 doctoral students.

 2.1 Staff Profile
 Since 2014 we have appointed 38 (27.7FTE) new researchers - including 4 ECRs - aligned to
 our research ambitions e.g. Love, who has led on research developments as SimVis grew from
 the Digital Design Studio to an academic school; and Johnson (ECR), our Innovation Leadership
 Fellow in the Creative Economy (AHRC-funded), whose research investigates the place of
 micro-enterprises within the creative sector. Since 2014, we have also awarded 13
 professorships (e.g. McHattie, Sinclair, Smith and Urban) in recognition of research, creative
 contributions and leadership.

 Our REF2021 submission includes 31% of our academic community with Significant
 Responsibility for Research (SRR), 22% of the SSR cohort were appointed in the period since
 2014 and 68% of the submitted staff hold a PhD representing a significant increase from 20% in
 REF2014. The table below provides a summary that reflects changes in our staffing profile since
 2014:

  submission

 GSA’s key research priority (2021-2027) is to strengthen and enhance the support and
 development of our research community. Our number of Cat A submitted staff has declined, due
 partly to the strategic identification of a new category of ‘emergent researcher’ as part of our
 Annual Research Planning (ARP) process. In terms of staff movement, 5 researchers have been
 promoted to senior roles in other HEIs (e.g. in 2016 Anderson took up the role of Dean of the
 School of Design, RCA; and Sharpe moved to Strathclyde in 2020 as their new Head of
 Architecture). The ‘emergent’ category identifies staff who wish to develop a research career
 trajectory but who do not yet have the requisite experience to do so independently. These staff
 are provided with research time and a tailored support programme including priority access to
 our new mentoring scheme (2020-). Currently, GSA has 58 (41 FTE) staff with research time
 who do not yet have SRR, 33 (21 FTE) of whom are emergent researchers and 6 of whom are
 ECRs. The others are mainly mid-career staff whose research has been curtailed, as an aspect
 of role, over this period due to the operational demands of the recent past. 6 ECRs from
 REF2014 are included in this submission (e.g. Taylor; MacKenzie) and although our percentage
 of ECRs (as defined by our CoP) in REF2021 has declined, we have considerable developing
 strength in our emergent group.

 Following REF2021, we will invest R&E resources to: 1) increase the percentage of our
 academics with SRR, including those who are currently emergent and those who wish to re-
 engage with research; and 2) enhance post-doctoral opportunities for our PGR community,
 building on our experience with Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs). As with REF2014, this
 submission includes less part-time than full-time staff which is consistent with GSA’s academic
 staff profile.

 2.3 Research Support and Oversight
 Professional Services in the R&E Dept (6 FTE) and the digital infrastructure for research and
 impact are overseen by the Deputy Director R&I (McAra-McWilliam) and led by the Head of R&E
 (Kirkpatrick) with the Director of REF Development (Smith). Following REF2014, GSA’s EIA
 identified a series of key actions required to enhance the research environment, including a
 systematic and consistent allocation of research time and a more structured and effective
 approach to mentoring.

 2.3 a) Annual Research Planning and Research Leave
 A key milestone in our strategy since 2014 has been the introduction of individual Annual
 Research Plans (ARPs) in 2016. The ARP process provides a comprehensive overview of
 individual plans, contributions and achievements, including research outputs, grant applications,
 PhD supervision and research-related academic citizenship. They are critical in developing and
 maintaining institutional oversight and understanding of GSA’s research profile, supporting
 schools with their strategic planning, targeting financial support, understanding individual and
 collective needs and aspirations and identifying gaps in our research support.

 Key to creating equitable workload and encouraging work-life balance, the ARP process is
 introduced to new staff during their induction and probation period and is open to all academic
 staff with a contract over 0.2FTE. The process is led and coordinated by the R&E Dept and
 ARPs are peer-reviewed by a team of senior researchers, independent of management
 structures to ensure the assessment is equitable. As part of our accelerated recovery, we are
 planning a focused ECR ARP pathway to support an identified cohort of 10 Emergent and Early
 Career Researchers annually, creating peer-to-peer action learning groups who will receive
 targeted investment, training and mentoring up to the submission of their first grant application.
 There are three potential outcomes from the ARP process: enhanced (40%), normative (c.20%),
 and emergent research time (20%). The research allocations at the point of REF submission are
 as follows:

 Research planning
  ARPs 20/21 on REF 2021 census date              FTE      Headcount    %
  Enhanced (40%)                                 16.2      20           19%
  Normative (20%)                                52.2      67           60%
  Emergent (20%) with priority access to support 18.7      30           21%

 In concert with the development and introduction of the ARP process, GSA also achieved the
 European Commission HR Excellence in Research Award (2016), confirming our strategic
 commitment to supporting our research communities to pursue quality research and develop and
 integrate their impact and KE skills.

 Since REF2014, GSA has awarded 32 periods of research leave to 29 researchers, which
 resulted in the completion of 41 outputs, including 7 monographs, 6 articles and 9 exhibited
 bodies of work. Our annual Research Leave Scheme is open to all staff on a minimum of a .2
 contract who have secured research time through the ARP process. In 2013-14 we awarded
 targeted research leave to 5 staff from the Schools of Design, Fine Art and Architecture who
 were not submitted to REF2014 to fast-track their research development. Of those, 3 are
 included in REF2021 and one left GSA in 2019.

 2.3 b) Early Career Researchers
 As an SSI, emergent researchers and ECRs are an integral part of GSA’s academic community
 and are key to: growing quality research; succession planning; developing new generations of

                                                                                            Page 10
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 researchers; and sustaining robust teaching and research linkages, that are fundamental to
 GSA’s academic ethos. Our plan to develop a bespoke pathway to support 10 ECRs and
 emergent researchers per year is key to improving our resilience and sustainability.

 2.3 c) Research Leadership
 To strengthen cross-institutional and interdisciplinary dialogue and shared learning, in 2019 the
 Director of REF Development (Smith) convened and chaired a group of professors and senior
 researchers to: oversee and review the quality of research outputs; consider REF and research-
 related strategy to advise the Senior Leadership Group (SLG); and mentor practice-based
 researchers and those working on Impact Case Studies in preparation for our submission to
 REF2021. As an effective cross-GSA ‘action learning set’ this research leadership group has
 enabled GSA’s SLG to gain an evidence-based overview of our institutional and interdisciplinary
 strengths, our strategic opportunities and our future challenges. To support staff development
 and to foster future leadership, the group also includes a number of mid (McCormack) and early
 career (Broadley) researchers. Supported by Dept of R&E, this group will continue beyond
 REF2021 as means to develop a distributed and collaborative model of research leadership and
 take a more schematic approach to achieving our strategic research objectives and deploying
 central resources.

 2.3 d) Staff Development:
 GSA’s staff development strategy aims to provide an extensive programme of development
 opportunities to support all staff (academic and professional) and enhance the performance of
 GSA. For our researchers, this includes:
     • Active membership of relevant creative and professional research networks (ARMA,
         VITAE, UK Council of Research Repositories (UKCoRR), PRAGUK, JISC Research
         Network) and subject associations (e.g., CHEAD UK; CAA USA; ELIA EU) contributing to
         debates, gaining sector intelligence and sharing good practice. Prior to Brexit, GSA was
         a member of UKRO (UK Research Office) and Scotland Europa.
     • A portfolio of GSA-specific strategic briefings, workshops, training sessions and events
         aimed at bringing staff together to share insights and stimulate dialogue.
     • Externally provided training through Scottish and UK-wide agencies to maximise
         development opportunities including leadership development, mentoring and
         unconscious bias training e.g. Advance HE ‘Strategic Leadership Programme’ (Smith,
         2019-20); Scottish Crucible, The Royal Society of Edinburgh (Poyade) and GSA’s
         participation in the Teaching, Research and Academic Mentoring Scheme (TRAMS)
         partnership led by Universities of St Andrews and Dundee

 The R&E Dept ensures that our strategic development needs for research are identified and met
 through a tailored staff development programme. To enhance our programme, in 2015 we
 launched our cross-school ‘Sharing Knowledge and Insights’ (SKI) series to stimulate
 discussion, interdisciplinary debate and to support the socialisation of our researcher
 community. SKI events are presented by GSA staff and invited external experts (e.g. from
 AHRC, Vitae and BA/Leverhulme representatives) and cover practical topics such as ‘how to get
 published,’ and ‘writing for impact,’ as well as providing a cross-GSA platform for sharing our
 latest research and facilitating discussion on sectoral issues for Art & Design such as ‘open
 access for practice-based research.’

 In addition to REF2021 preparation, including equalities training from Advance HE, online
 provision of Research Integrity Training - including ethics and safeguarding (University of
 Dundee) - and participation in TRAMS (32 GSA mentors e.g. Guidicini and Peter; and 13 GSA
 mentees e.g. McAra and Boyle), since REF2014, 48 GSA-specific development sessions have
 been provided for staff. These included the development and launch of a bespoke GSA
 research mentoring scheme (in concert with TRAMS) to address our specialist needs and
 facilitated writing retreats - and training of GSA staff as retreat facilitators (Thompson) - to
 provide support for researchers and PGR students. To complement this, the R&E Dept staff
 have been active in contributing to national debates (e.g. Open Research for Creative and


                                                                                            Page 11

 Practice Research) and developing their skills (AHEA, IP/Copyright training, digital curation) to
 enhance support for academic staff.

 2.4 a) PGR Investment
 Since REF2014, we have made a strategic investment in our PGR programme, resulting in a
 PGR enrolment increase of 71% (from 31 to 53) and a doubling of PhD completions (from 20 to
 40). We also awarded 5 PhDs by publication (validated in 2013-14 by our degree awarding
 body, University of Glasgow) including to 4 staff members (Cooper, Evans, Rodger and Sinclair).
 In addition, we have moved from a central Graduate School model to one that aligns with our
 school structure. As an SSI with an imperative to strengthen interdisciplinary capability and
 collaborative research supervision, in 2014 we took the strategic decision to become a founding
 member of the SGSAH, funded as part of the AHRC Doctoral Training Partnerships programme
 (£5,521,362 in 2014-19 and £16,962,182 in 2019-24). Our Head of Doctoral Studies
 (Thompson), working with a team of 5 school-based PGR coordinators, has overseen an
 ongoing programme of growth and improvement. Governance oversight and quality assurance is
 provided by the PGR Research Degrees Sub-Committee (RDSC), reporting to REC and
 Academic Council. A successful internal periodic review of PGR provision (2018) commended
 our enhancements to researcher training and community building.

 For GSA, membership of the SGSAH represents a major investment over a decade but has
 provided a significant enhancement of resources and opportunities for our PGR students and
 increased levels of cross-institutional supervision as well as external quality and policy
 benchmarks. It provides cross-institutional training and development to arts and humanities PGR
 candidates in 16 Scottish HEIs, with just 8 of those in DTP1 (2014-2019) and 10 in DTP2 (2019-
 24) able to bid for co-funded studentships, including GSA. Between 2014-2020 we invested over
 £300K in membership fees and co-funding of studentships as well as contributing to SGSAH
 governance and management, peer-review panels, training activities, coordination of discipline-
 specific programmes and cross-institutional supervision. In addition to accessing scholarships,
 membership of SGSAH provides our students with an annual Doctoral Summer School (40+
 events) including methods workshops, discipline-specific training and KE and careers
 programmes plus funding for development activities proposed and organised by groups of PhDs.
 Since joining, 6 GSA students undertook paid SGSAH residencies or internships with, for
 example, RSPB, Dundee Contemporary Arts and Scotland’s Future Forum. To support student
 applications for funding in 2018 we introduced rigorous internal review processes which has
 improved our SGSAH awards to an average of 3 per year.

 2.4 c) GSA Research Training
 All incoming PGR students undertake a mandatory Research Degrees Training Programme
 (updated 2017-18). Drawing on sector benchmarks including the Vitae RDF and aligned to our
 disciplinary needs, students are trained in key aspects of PGR study, including methods,
 literature reviews, developing research questions and defining and understanding the nature of
 practice research in a creative arts context. It culminates in an annual symposium, showcasing
 first-year students’ research projects to peers, GSA staff and invited guests. All students
 complete an annual training needs analysis and receive a training account to fund their specific
 development activities. Students participate in SGSAH training as well as GSA’s own
 programme, which includes staff development activities, SKI Tuesdays, writing retreats and
 ‘pop-up’ sessions responding to cohort needs. In addition to regular inductions, workshops and
 training, our library staff provide one-to-one sessions for our PGRs, invite them to curate
 collections - e.g. a collection of LGBTQ books for History Month - and work closely with them
 and our student association to broaden and diversity the library collection.

 Since 2015-16 we have run and developed our GTA Scheme (funded by the Research
 Excellence Grant) giving PGR students the opportunity to gain teaching experience, supported
 by an academic mentor, which develops graduate skills and confidence and integrates research
 and teaching. During the pandemic, where required, GSA provided co-funded studentship and
 fee-waiver extensions and access to hardship funds and additional equipment.

 2.4. d) Supervision
 There are currently 54 active supervisors at GSA, 30 as primary supervisors. Our PGR provision
 is supported by a core group of 43 senior staff, whose reputations as educators, artists,
 architects and designers provide a draw for prospective PhD candidates. To qualify as a primary
 supervisor at GSA, staff must have supervised a PhD to completion, hold a PhD or complete
 GSA’s PG Cert in Supervision. Since 2013/14, 17 staff have completed the PG Cert. Regulatory
 standards are maintained through regular mandatory supervisor training following the
 expectations of SGSAH. To strategically grow supervisory capacity we are actively placing
 emergent researchers and ECRs in supervisory teams under the mentorship of experienced
 colleagues in the role of primary supervisor.

 2.5 Supporting Equality and Diversity in Research Careers
 GSA is committed to ensuring EDI is integral to all activities and functions in line with our duties
 as a public sector body in Scotland. Our equalities outcomes goals include:
     • an organisational culture in which respect for self and others is understood and practised;
        where identity-based ignorance or prejudice is challenged and confidence promoted
     • an increased number of people from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds contributing
        to learning, teaching and research at GSA and engaging with diverse local communities

                                                                                                                                                               Page 13
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

    •   development of a fair pay and career progression framework that underpins equality of
        opportunity for all, actively works towards reducing the gender pay gap and addresses
        occupational segregation
    •   an objective to increase the proportion of female staff submitting research for audit and
        inclusion in REF2021
    •   achieving Equality Impact Assessment Actions (EIA) with respect to REF2021
    •   working to ensure equality of opportunity for all staff in respect of participation in
        Research and Enterprise activities as relevant to role profiles

 GSA supports the principles of Athena SWAN and has an outstanding commitment to SFC to
 work towards an application, through the ‘small specialist institution’ route (delayed by recent
 events). Our successful application in 2016 to the HR Excellence in Research award established
 a framework and baseline data for our future application, specifically supporting equality and
 diversity in the recruitment and retention of researchers (see section 2.1).

 We have seen an improvement in the Cat A percentage of women staff submitted to REF2021 –
 56% compared with 40% in 2014. In addition, the gender pay gap within the Cat A grouping is
 smaller at -9.4% than GSA’s as a whole which is -15.4% (GSA Equal Pay Review, April 2019).
 The BAME data for this group is, at 5.7%, broadly equivalent to the GSA workforce (5.8%), 3%
 of the cohort declared a disability and 6 staff took a period of maternity leave, which is 60% of
 the total academic staff maternity leave cohort since REF2014, strongly suggesting no
 impediment to research. There was 1 period of paternity leave.

 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities

 3.1 External Income for Research, Knowledge Exchange and Impact
 Since REF2014 we have increased our average annual external research, KE, impact and other
 research-related income by 61% to £3.3m (£66.5k per [SRR] head).

  Research Income by Academic Year (see REF 4b) [GBP]
  2013/14     2014/15    2015/16     2016/17      2017/18   2018/19                   2019/20
  2,325,000   3,959,000  4,069,000   3,916,000    2,793,000 3,217,000                 2,742,000

 This represents a diverse range of funding and activity (more than 300 projects), underpinned by
 a core of high-quality research. We have succeeded in our aim to grow our portfolio of UKRI
 grants, as lead applicants (15 AHRC awards, including 5 Follow-On Funding) and through
 strategic, interdisciplinary collaboration (21 awards, including ESRC, EPSRC, MRC and NERC,
 some GCRF-based). Together with grants from bodies such as RSE and Leverhulme, this work
 accounts for around 15% of research income.

  UKRI Grant Income (excluding Innovate UK) [GBP]
  2013/14     2014/15     2015/16     2016/17     2017/18               2018/19       2019/20

 The majority of our research income facilitates applied research, experimental development and
 KE, particularly in the strategic domain of Health and Care. We have secured significant
 investment from health and hospital authorities, local authorities and government bodies, and
 our role as core partner in the DHI (ICS 4) accounts for 25% of income since REF2014. Further
 investment from NHS Education Scotland, Scottish Health Boards and individual trusts, NIHR,
 CSO and charitable bodies enables work in medical visualisation and design-led service
 improvement.

 Our research contribution to sustainable economic development in Scotland is also driven by
 investment from public bodies, including through GCC’s ongoing strategic partnership in GUL
 (2014-2020: £151k), and Highlands and Islands Enterprise’s support for our work with creative
 economy SMEs in the region through the Creative Futures Partnership (2014-19) at GSA’s

                                                                                            Page 14
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 Highlands & Islands campus, on the Altyre Estate near Forres. In addition, we have targeted
 impact-orientated competitive grants to facilitate built environment research and KE, and
 received £1.3m from Innovate UK, Construction Scotland Innovation Centre and Interface (ICS
 1), including 5 KTPs in partnership with architects and housing associations. Collaboration with
 Historic Environment Scotland, Scottish Government and National Trust for Scotland (£1.5m)
 early in this REF period focused on the completion of large-scale heritage visualisation projects.
 This capability, developed through an earlier phase of research, is now provided as consultancy
 and commercial services, with proceeds reinvested in the research environment.

 Other Income
 As is characteristic of our sector, Cat A submitted staff also secured investment in their research
 from sources not reflected in annual HESA returns, for example Birrell (Creative Scotland, £99k),
 Boyle (Hauser & Wirth, £35k), Bird (Heritage Lottery, £16,700; Atlas Arts, £5k), McBride
 (Creative Scotland, £15k), Ursitti (Creative Scotland, £11,300), Carter (Arts Council England,
 £5k), Nielsen (Stiftung Arp e.V., €2k).

 3.2 Infrastructure to Support Research and Impact

 3.2 a) Committee and Reporting Structures
 Policy development, planning, governance and oversight are formally provided by our Research
 and Enterprise Committee (REC), convened by the Deputy Director R&I (McAra-McWilliam), and
 reporting each semester to our senior committee, Academic Council. School-based Research
 and Enterprise Sub-committees report to REC, as does the Research Degrees Subcommittee.
 R&E, with the Finance Dept, is also responsible for the full economic costing/transparent
 approach to costing working group, fEC/TRAC.

 Research infrastructure is underpinned by the core QR grants from the SFC, consisting of the
 Research Excellence Grant (REG), Universities Innovation Fund (UIF) and Research
 Postgraduate Grants (RPG). Organisational support for research and impact is provided by the
 central R&E Dept, reporting to the Deputy Director R&I, and responsible for research policy,
 governance, funding and grant support (including post-award), researcher development, open
 research, quality assurance, REF preparation, alignment with research concordats and
 postgraduate research. Managed by the Head of R&E and the Director of REF Development, the
 team comprises the Head of Doctoral Studies, Research and Impact Development Officer,
 Knowledge Exchange Manager (vacancy), Repository Manager, Research Information
 Coordinator, Research Finance Officer and two administrators. Among the team’s
 responsibilities are the maintenance of the RADAR research repository (see section 3.2b) and
 institution-wide Pipeline database system for planning, tracking and reporting project and grant
 development and delivery. Since 2015, we have invested 27% of QR income in maintaining this
 core capacity.

 Five senior academics, one per school, are also part-funded (total: 10% of QR) to ensure
 integration and coordination of central and local needs and priorities. These act as local
 research leads and their role includes: convening the School’s research subcommittee;
 overseeing school-level internal funding bids; providing mentoring and guidance to researchers;
 membership of the central research leadership group convened by Smith; and representing their
 School on REC and in all aspects of REF planning. Since 2014, a proportion of QR has been
 invested to sustain specific research-intensive posts in key areas of activity. These have
 included Macdonald, Sharpe, Cooper, Jeffrey, Sinclair, MacKenzie, Poyade, Abbott and Calvert.

 Research support services are provided to all researchers, including ECRs and emergent
 researchers, irrespective of FTE, SRR status or level of experience. Institutional Research
 Development Funding (RDF) is available to all research active staff via a peer-reviewed
 application process. The scheme supports research leadership, small and developmental
 projects, co-funding for external grants and research dissemination. Since 2014, we have
 made 399 awards (£417k). The Research Leave Scheme releases staff from teaching and
 administration in order to make significant progress towards research objectives. Awards are

                                                                                             Page 15
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 made as appropriate to career stage, on the basis of quality and potential, through peer review
 and with the support of line managers. Since 2014, 32 periods of leave were awarded (£135k),
 with average duration of 9 weeks, which have led to the completion of REF2 outputs for Urban
 (7447), McMullan (7538), McCormack (4405), Ursitti (7541), Birrell (7528; 7529), Guidicini
 (7252), Carter (7532), Rodger (5638) and Smith (4820). Staff can also apply for RDF Impact
 Awards to facilitate the impact of their research (see 1.2.4b).

 The R&E Dept coordinates the research mentoring schemes and SKI Tuesday programme
 (Section 2.3.d). Information, advice and guidance - including research handbook - is provided to
 all staff via GSA’s intranet and through regular electronic bulletins. R&E also maintains
 subscriptions for staff to relevant creative and professional research networks (see section 2.3d).

 3.2 b) Space and Facilities
 The £50m, purpose-built Reid Building, opened in 2014, houses the School of Design and is the
 main reception building of the GSA campus. It accommodates both Design-specific and cross-
 GSA facilities, available to our researchers and PGRs, including wood, metal-working and
 plastics workshops, digital fabrication facilities, Media Studio, the Case Room (traditional
 letterpress printmaking), the Centre for Advanced Textiles (CAT), a 300-seat lecture theatre,
 interdisciplinary project and seminar rooms, space for public engagement, specialist
 silversmithing equipment, textile equipment, the Mackintosh Furniture Gallery (relocated
 following the 2014 fire) and the international standard, publicly accessible Reid Gallery. The
 School of Fine Art Stow building, acquired in 2016 and occupied in 2018, includes further
 specialist wood, metal and making workshops as well as dedicated photography labs and a
 recording studio, also available to our researchers and PGRs. In addition, Stow includes shared
 studio and office space for PGR students. SimVis’s dedicated premises are equipped with
 specialist technical facilities, also available to our researcher community, including one of the
 largest 3D (4k) interactive projection spaces in Europe, an industry standard dubbing studio,
 suites of high-capacity graphics and animation computers, motion capture equipment, laser
 scanning and photogrammetry equipment, haptic interface testing facilities and a usability testing
 studio. Our Highlands and Islands campus near Forres provides a base for research and KE
 programmes, including aspects of the DHI provision and creative economy research.

 Central to our facilities and resources infrastructure are our Galleries, Archives & Collection. Due
 to our specialist status, resources and assets, GSA receives an annual Museums, Galleries and
 Collections Grant (£264k in 2019/20) from SFC to support our exhibitions programme, archives
 and collections, enhancing curatorial and archival access and opportunities for the research
 community. 33% of our exhibitions programme since 2014 has been research-related. The Reid
 Gallery and Ground Floor Corridor Gallery represent 310m2 of exhibition space; and the Reid
 building also includes an interpretation and visitor centre, ‘Windows on the Mack’ (150m2), which
 displays items from the collection.

 GSA’s Mackintosh Collection has Museum and Galleries Scotland ‘Nationally Significant
 Collection’ recognition. Although the collection incurred significant loss and damage in the 2014
 Mack fire (and some further loss in the 2018 fire), much of it has been subsequently conserved
 and digitised. Our Archive & Collections (A&C) - relocated in 2015 to The Whiskey Bond in
 Glasgow’s West End after the 2014 fire - consist of a continually developing set of records and
 artefacts relating to the school’s activities since its foundation in 1845, comprising one of the
 UK’s most comprehensive archives of art, design and architecture education. It contains items
 pertaining to C.R. Mackintosh, his peers and former GSA staff and students, including around
 200 plaster casts, 400+ textiles items and commercial design collections including the Stoddart
 Templeton Archive. A&C includes viewing and research spaces to support GSA’s and external
 researchers and the public.

 This digital collection is key to enhancing our scholarly and public access and to expanding our
 civic role in the context of the 2013-14 opening of Reid Building (which marked the significant
 expansion of our public galleries by 66%), and Glasgow City Council’s ongoing Avenues Project
 (£115M) which embraces GSA’s campus within the wider urban regeneration of Glasgow City

                                                                                              Page 16
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 Centre. Since REF2014, 9 GSA researchers working with heritage, archives and collections
 have attracted over £1.16M of funding from SFC, the Art Fund and Royal Society of Edinburgh,
 developed 28 exhibitions, 68 community workshops and produced over 20 publications linked to
 Scottish collections, including GSA’s own collections and archives. Despite the loss of the
 Mackintosh Museum and the temporary closures of the Reid Gallery (following both fires) over
 this period, GSA held 69 exhibitions and 88 events.

 GSA’s library service, located in our Bourdon Building (also home to MSA), provides staff and
 students with access to an extensive collection of subject-specific print and online resources.
 Many of our rare and special books, stored in the Mackintosh Library and destroyed in the 2014
 fire, are being replaced through an acquisitions and donations campaign. Membership of the
 Scottish Higher Education Digital Library, broadens the scope of our small and specialist library,
 giving our researchers digital access to extensive humanities resources. The library holds more
 than 15 special collections of rare or historical volumes, including sources of visual material,
 artist’s books, decorative papers, theses and dissertations, exhibition catalogues and design
 libraries. As associate members of staff of the University of Glasgow, GSA researchers also
 have access to the vast and comprehensive collections of the University of Glasgow library,
 encompassing a wide range of subjects that are not included within our own collections.

 RADAR is central to our digital infrastructure and the dissemination of all GSA’s research
 outputs. Since its launch it has been systematically and regularly enhanced through the addition
 of a research blog, its connection to the British Library EThOS initiative, the electronic archiving
 of PhD theses and the development of opportunities to capture and disseminate multi-modal
 practice research outputs.

 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society

         a. Collaborations, Networks and Partnerships
 GSA has developed strategic partnerships with the following national and international
 organisations: CCA Glasgow; NHS Scotland, United Nations and Glasgow City Council. Our
 international strategic relationships are focused predominantly in China and include a formal
 teaching and research partnership with Luxun Academy of Fine Arts, Shenyang, China. We are
 one of 13 members of the Scottish university sector Energy Technology Partnership (ETP) and a
 member of the Scottish Universities Insight Institute (SUII), a HE-led network focused on KE
 between humanities and social sciences and civic, community and charitable organisations.

 GSA has worked with more than 225 partners across 125 collaborative, funded research and KE
 projects, including at least: 45 UK HEIs (e.g. University of Ulster; RCA; University of Edinburgh),
 33 international HEIs (e.g. Ghent University; University of Toronto; Washington State University:
 University of the West Indies), 24 cultural organisations (e.g. Documenta, the V&A Dundee and
 London; Cairngorms National Park Authority; National Trust for Scotland; Pier Arts Centre), 12
 NHS organisations, 13 other Government and public bodies (e.g. Creative Scotland, Public
 Health England; Highlands & Islands Enterprise), 43 UK companies (e.g. Scottish Power, Velux,
 Four Walls Consultancy, Moorbrook Textiles), 8 international companies (e.g. Siemens,
 Perceptive Engineering; RAND Europe), 9 housing associations (e.g. Charing Cross Housing
 Association, Eildon Housing Association), 8 community organisations (e.g. Arisaig Community
 Trust; Kilmartin House Trust; Moray Wellbeing Hub) and 12 other charities.

         b. Contributions to the Research Base, Economy and Society
 GSA’s researchers make a significant contribution to the sector and perform a range of
 citizenship roles for: research councils; grant awarding bodies; disciplinary societies; advisory
 and editorial boards; peer review panels; juries and selection panels; and conference organising
 committees. Their contribution is also evidenced in various residencies, visiting professorships,
 conference and symposia keynote addresses.
