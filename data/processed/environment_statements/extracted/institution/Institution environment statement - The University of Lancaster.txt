 1. Context and mission

 1.1.    Overview
 1.1.1   Our goal is research of world-leading quality, insight and influence. We have invested
         significantly in our people and facilities to achieve this and to better our REF2014 result
         of 83% research ranked as either internationally significant or world leading. We are
         committed to pioneering research and impact that has local, regional, national and global
         reach and significance across a true universality of fields.

 1.1.2   Established in 1964 by Royal Charter, we are one of only 6 UK collegiate universities.
         Our main campus, situated within 300 acres of parkland south of the city of Lancaster, is
         home to a vibrant, diverse and inclusive community of staff and students (figure 1.1).

 1.1.3   Our uniqueness is exemplified by: the Centre for Global Eco-innovation; the Centre for
         Research and Evidence on Security Threats - combining behavioural and technological
         perspectives; the Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science; the Health Innovation
         Campus; IsoLab – our advanced environment for studying quantum systems; The Ruskin
         - the largest collection of Ruskin’s works; the Work Foundation – the leading think-tank
         for improving work in the UK; the first British university campus in sub-Saharan Africa
         (Ghana) and as partners in two Chinese Academy of Science institutes: Guangzhou
         Institute of Geochemistry and the Institute of Urban Environment.

 1.1.4   Our ‘Strategy for 2020’ has three equally important priorities:
              Research that changes practice and thinking
              Teaching that transforms people’s lives and society
              Engagement with students, businesses and our communities.

 1.1.5   To deliver our strategy we have grown staff and student numbers (figure 1.1), research
         and engagement income, research impact, and invested in our estate to secure world-
         class research facilities (see sections 2 and 4).

 1.1.6   As a Civic University signatory, our priorities align with those of our local partners and we
         support the rural and relatively disadvantaged communities and economies across the
         north-west of England. We bolster this through membership of the N8 Research
         Partnership, cementing our reach and scale to deliver benefits to the economy and
         communities of the North and beyond.

 1.1.7   We were Times ‘University of the Year 2018’ and Sunday Times ‘International University
         of the Year 2020’. We have ranked in the top-10 of the three main UK league tables
         since 2016 and our QS University Ranking has increased from 156th (2014) to 136th
         (2021). We were awarded a Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Engineering and Technology
         for ‘Furthering Understanding in Language’ (2015) and since REF2014 seven of our staff
         have been recognised in the Queen’s honours lists (for example Professor Louise
         Heathwaite was awarded a CBE in 2018).




                                                                                                Page 1

 1.2.    Structure
 1.2.1   Lancaster has four faculties:
             Arts and Social Sciences – comprising >20 disciplines across 9 departments and
              home to Lancaster Arts, providing professional arts, public performances and
              exhibitions. In REF2014, over 80% of research activity was rated as world-leading
              and internationally excellent.
             Health and Medicine – spanning clinical, applied health, biomedical, medical and
              social science disciplines addressing prominent 21st-century challenges including
              ageing, mental health, epidemiology, social and economic inequality. In REF2014
              the Faculty ranked equal first with 100% 4* 'research environment' and third for
              intensity weighted GPA with 99% of eligible staff returned.
             Lancaster University Management School – comprising 6 departments and the
              Work Foundation, ranked the top UK business school for 'research power' in
              REF2014. The School carries quadruple accreditation by the leading international
              business school accrediting bodies.
             Science and Technology – research across chemistry, computing and
              communication, engineering, environment, mathematics and statistics, physics and
              psychology. In REF2014, over 80% of research activity was rated as world-leading
              and internationally excellent.

 1.2.2   We have four cross-faculty Research Institutes (Data Science, Materials Science,
         Security and Social Futures) addressing grand challenges facing society through
         interdisciplinary research (2.1.3).

 1.2.3   We have invested in senior leadership of research and impact through new roles and
         appointments during the period. This includes two Pro-Vice-Chancellors, for Research
         and Enterprise and for Engagement (new in 2018) and two Cross-Faculty Associate
         Deans covering Research, and Enterprise and Engagement (new in 2018 and 2020).

2. Strategy

 2.1.   Research
 2.1.1. Delivery of our strategy to ‘undertake research of the very highest quality by international
        standards, as recognised by our peers and by users and adopters’ is evidenced by the
        following outcomes:
             Increased research outputs and field weighted citation impact (table 2.1);
             More international partnerships, extending our reach and significance (table 2.1);

                                                                                              Page 2
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
            Significant research income growth (figure 4.1);
            Growth in grant applications and awards (figure 4.3).

 2.1.2. These outcomes have been enabled by:
           New structures to facilitate interdisciplinary research (2.1.3);
           Work with external stakeholders to maximise research impact (Error! Reference
             source not found.2.2);
           Supporting our research students and researchers, especially during early career
             stages (3.2);
           Investment in research infrastructure and facilities (section 4).

 Table 2.1 Research performance (SciVal)

 2.1.3. Our interdisciplinary research organisation drives major, cross-cutting initiatives targeting
        complex global challenges outside traditional faculty structures. Researchers are
        encouraged to contribute to our flagship Research Institutes and Institutional Research
        Centres (Ageing; Energy; Global Eco-innovation; Ruskin Library, Museum and Research
        Centre (The Ruskin); Mobility; and the Pentland Centre for Sustainability in Business).

 2.1.4. Senior academic experts, recruited internally, internationally and from industry, lead our
        Research Institutes to drive large-scale interdisciplinary initiatives, such as the £3M
        EPSRC project Future Places possible only due to collaboration between Social Futures
        and Data Science. Following investment of £2.6M since REF2014 the Institutes have
        acquired significant funding (£39.6M) and produced high-quality interdisciplinary
        research with impact via 3,782 outputs with 59,422 citations (SciVal).

 2.1.5. Our Research Centres target external engagement opportunities in areas of research
        excellence to leverage funding and impact, evidenced through £33M European Structural
        Investment Fund (ESIF) projects for eco-innovation; criticalities around museums of the
        future and cultural leadership via The Ruskin; and informing sustainability dialogues at
        the World Economic Forum.

 2.1.6. We devolve mainstream QR to faculties and departments to invest in staff (figure 1.1),
        infrastructure and facilities (section 4) and discipline-specific research that engages with
        regional and national research priorities. Key projects underpinned by QR since
        REF2014 include:
             £11.8M ESRC Centre for Research and Evidence on Security Threats: UK hub for
              behavioural and social science research led by Lancaster;
             £3.8M ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science: cutting-edge
              methods in the study of language;
             £2.5M NIHR Applied Research Collaboration North West Coast: multi-partner
              research in health inequalities and barriers, translating discoveries into practice;
             £2.3M EPSRC OR-MASTER: Mathematical models and algorithms for allocating
              scarce airport resources.

 2.1.7. We invest QR to enable institutional strategic growth, for example in our Research
        Institutes (2.1.3) and Doctoral Academy (3.4). QR enabled the recruitment and bespoke
        mentoring of future research leaders through our 50th anniversary lectureship scheme.
        Their successes since 2014 include 29 internal promotions, including three fast-tracked
        to Professor, >£8M in awarded grants, and 843 scholarly outputs with >13,000 citations
        (SciVal).


                                                                                               Page 3
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)

 2.1.8. Additional institutional QR awards have further supported relevant grants and enabled
        new research initiatives that support the development of outcomes, impact and our staff.
        It has allowed us to forge new partnerships and collaborations with overseas
        organisations and local, regional, national and international policymakers. For example,
        facilitating the £7M Recirculate project which supports new partnership-based
        approaches to enable African researchers to grow transformational impact with, in and
        for their communities.

 2.1.9   The principles and practices of open research at Lancaster University exemplify core
         values embedded within Lancaster’s moto, patet omnibus veritas (truth lies open to all),
         underpinned by our membership of the UK Reproducibility Network. As a signatory to the
         San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment we advocate responsible use of
         metrics. Due to our commitment in this area, our UKRI open access compliancy has
         improved from 55% in 2013/14 to 93% in 2019/20.

 2.1.10 Commitment to the Concordat to Support Research Integrity, the Concordat on Openness
        in Animal Research, and our commitment to enhance equality, diversity and inclusion
        (3.3) drives Lancaster’s culture of research integrity. Annual research integrity reports
        since 2013-14 are publically available. Staff training and ethical review ensures our
        research respects the dignity, rights and welfare of participants and that minimises risks
        to participants, researchers and third parties.

 2.2.    Impact and engagement
 2.2.1   Achievement of our strategy to apply ‘our collective intellectual and wider capabilities for
         economic and societal benefit across regional, national and international dimensions’
         was enabled through investment in support structures and facilities (section 4) and
         changes to our academic promotion and awards criteria (3.1.3). Successes include:
             Increased partnerships with communities, businesses, government departments
              and other agents of social and economic change and development, working with
              >620 research partners;
             Growth in relevant funding (table 2.2);
             External recognition, such as being named the leading HEI nationally for economic
              development in the 2016 Higher Education Business and Community Interaction
              survey.

                                                                  REF2014             REF2021
     Industry research grant income                           £12,002,983          £27,125,801
     Higher Education Innovation Funding (HEIF)                £9,328,667          £21,375,199
     Impact Acceleration Account (IAA) funding                    £600,000           £3,613,000

 Table 2.2 Growth in impact-enabling awards

 2.2.2   As a signatory to the Concordat for Engaging the Public with Research and the Manifesto
         for Public Engagement, we use HEIF and other external funding (including £83M ESIF
         during the period) to drive research-led engagement and impact. A 2019 independent
         impact assessment found £28 of economic benefits were realised per £1 of public
         funding received by Lancaster.

 2.2.3   We stimulate research that is responsive and relevant to societal challenges and industry
         needs, with an emphasis on co-design, co-production and co-delivery. Exemplars
         include:
             £5M EPSRC Prosperity Partnership with BT focused on developing and delivering
               the future digital infrastructure for the UK;




                                                                                               Page 4
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
             £33M ESIF eco-innovation projects enabling the development of new products and
              services with environmental benefits through 41 PhD and 69 MRes projects
              designed with small and medium-sized businesses.

 2.2.4   IAA funding has supported researchers to further impact through competitive internal
         awards and enabled work with >250 external partners. The last report submitted to the
         EPSRC (2017-2020 IAA award) showed 47 of 51 projects funded are continuing post-IAA
         and leveraging >£8.5M further income, translating to a return of >£10 for every £1 of
         EPSRC IAA funding. Impacts produced from IAA funding included a significant
         collaboration with the UK Environment Agency to raise flood awareness and resilience in
         adults and young people by increasing the reach of digital resources developed from our
         research data. The work is directly referenced in the 2019 Defra National Flood and
         Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy.

 2.2.5   We have built external relationships, generated new research opportunities and
         encouraged academic engagement by introducing new intellectual property and
         consultancy policies that offer generous revenue sharing arrangements for all parties.
         Starting from a low base, we have seen consultancy increase thirty-fold since the new
         policy launched in 2019.

 2.2.6   Our regional context is an important element of our research environment. We were an
         early signatory to the Civic University Agreement and we work closely with regional Local
         Enterprise Partnerships, FE Colleges, local authorities, NHS trusts and community and
         third sector bodies. Lancaster Arts, The Ruskin and our Regional Heritage Centre are
         examples of high-quality research activities focused on distinctive, regional contexts with
         global significance.

 2.2.7   Our staff participate in a wide range of free public and community engagement events,
         providing opportunities to learn about, and participate in, research. Activities include
         public lectures, festivals, and local and national events such as Campus in the City, Light
         up Lancaster, and Sex, Bugs & Rock ‘n’ Roll at Glastonbury.

 2.3.    Future strategies
 2.3.1   The new university strategy, published April 2021, builds on our previous achievements
         and reaffirms the three pillars of research, engagement and teaching at Lancaster.

 2.3.2   The continuity of ambition and reassertion of research intensity will be achieved through
         supporting and growing interdisciplinary research; increasing and diversifying research
         income; and improving the quality and reach of our research and impact to achieve
         ‘research that changes practice and thinking’.

 2.3.3   We will continue the ongoing development of impactful interfaces between research,
         enterprise and engagement. In part, this will be realised through the continuation of
         leadership in prominent, collaborative, interdisciplinary research that addresses societal
         challenges at regional, national and global levels. This includes our involvement in the
         flagship Eden Project North that will bring significant and transformative impact to our
         local area.

 2.3.4   Initial activities on our campuses in Beijing Jiatong University (China), Lancaster
         University Ghana, Sunway University (Malaysia) and Lancaster University Leipzig
         (Germany) have focused on teaching, and future strategies will focus on developing
         research agendas with these partners.

3. People

 3.1.    Strategic development
 3.1.1   We have achieved the aims of our People Strategy to:

                                                                                              Page 5
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
             Attract and recruit the best staff nationally and internationally (3.1.2);
             Develop and support staff to fulfil their potential and meet their career aspirations
              (3.2);
             Retain and reward our staff through recognising their contributions (3.1.2, 3.1.3);
             Promote and secure excellence in leadership and management (3.2.3);
             Create and maintain a progressive, collaborative and healthy working environment
              (section 3).

 3.1.2   An institutional annual review of planning and resources provides opportunity to make
         adjustments that reflect new areas of growth through high calibre staff appointments or
         strategic investments. This has resulted in 45% growth in our research staff (figure 1.1)
         since REF2014. On average ‘Teaching and Research’ Staff are allocated 30% workload
         for research. Our commitment to reducing the use of fixed-term contracts wherever
         possible, has had a significant effect since this policy was introduced in 2019 (fig. 3.1).
         Our redeployment policy enables us, where possible, to retain the talent, skills and
         experience of our employees when an individual’s post is due to end.




 Figure 3.1 Fixed term contracts: Headcount of all research staff by gender

 3.1.3   We reward excellence in research, teaching, academic leadership and engagement
         through academic promotion recognising differing degrees of emphasis across these
         criteria at different career levels and stages. Recognising disciplinary differences,
         evidence of advancement in research comprises the reach and significance of outputs
         and impacts, including demonstrating very considerable research impacts; research
         income; management and leadership; mentoring; international recognition; and
         interdisciplinary work. While female staff are over-represented in promotion applications
         (average 39.8% of applications over last 6 years compared to 36.4% of the eligible pool)
         and more likely than men to be successful in their application (42.5% of successful
         cases), there is ongoing work to ensure continued female success to address the
         underlying gender inequality in our academic staff population (figures 3.2 and 3.3a).




                                                                                              Page 6

 3.1.4   Our annual institutional and faculty-level staff awards for excellence and for embodying
         Lancaster’s values celebrate outstanding contributions. Since 2019 there has been a
         dedicated Research Impact award, to reward the most innovative of our researchers. It
         can be awarded to an individual or a team, and combines a monetary award with public
         recognition at our annual graduation ceremonies.

 3.1.5   Our suite of people-related policies and procedures includes a policy for sabbatical leave
         designed to advance the pursuit of scholarship, research and the development of our
         staff that has resulted in 304 paid sabbaticals since 2016/17. Our bullying, harassment
         and sexual misconduct and safeguarding policies protect and support both our staff and
         collaborators. Lancaster supports flexible working and has both local informal approvals
         to assist colleagues manage the varying responsibilities of work and home life, and a
         more formal mechanism for staff to request temporary or permanent adjustments (38
         approved since records began in 2017).

 3.1.6   Regular staff surveys are used to inform areas for strategic improvements, such as newly
         constituted working-groups focused on work-life balance and supporting technical staff.
         Our staff intranet, launched in 2015, continues to improve internal communication (news
         homepage visited on average 18,700 times per week).

 3.1.7   Lancaster provides access to a range of professional support tools through an Employee
         Assistance Programme and has adopted the Five Ways to Wellbeing framework to help
         improve the health and wellbeing of our staff. A dedicated staff wellbeing website
         provides a central point of wellbeing resources. We provide an Access to Work Mental
         Health Support Service for people working and living with mental health difficulties and
         their employers and have mandatory mental health awareness training for all staff. Staff
         surveys consistently show that more than 80% of staff feel their wellbeing is valued by
         the University.

 3.2.    Staff development
 3.2.1   Our commitment to the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers
         empowers continual improvement to equal opportunities for research staff to contribute
         (3.2.2), develop (3.2.3) and progress (3.1.3), particularly those on fixed term contracts.

 3.2.2   Our Concordat Implementation Group, recognised through the European HR Excellence
         in Research award (awarded 2011, renewed successfully at the 8th year review in 2019)
         and underpinned by a code of practice, sets out the roles and responsibilities of Principal
         Investigators (PI), research staff and the University. We ensure opportunities for
         representation throughout our university committee structure.

 3.2.3   A full range of support and development programmes are available to our researchers
         underpinned by an annual personal development review and the opportunity for
         mentoring or coaching. All staff are actively encouraged to develop, starting with

                                                                                               Page 7

         ‘Introduction to Research at Lancaster’, which provides key information and advice on
         processes and procedures. Other programmes include PI development programmes,
         ‘Making Professor’ events, writing retreats and Lancaster’s flagship ‘Bonington
         Leadership Programme’ (48% female) for high-performing staff looking to take the next
         steps towards senior leadership.

 3.2.4   Career skills development for ECRs is delivered through bespoke training; signposting to
         external organisations; career mentoring and coaching; ECR representation on university
         committees; reduced teaching loads during probation; and support of the Research Staff
         Association that supports the career development of contract researchers. Together with
         Liverpool and Manchester Universities, we are a founding partner in Prosper, a £4.4M
         collaborative Research England Development project investigating alternative career
         pathways and development opportunities for post-doctoral researchers with a range of
         stakeholders including Unilever PLC, IBM and local enterprise partnerships.

 3.3.    Equality, diversity and inclusion
 3.3.1   Significant resource is deployed to analyse and refine our EDI policies and practices,
         with focal points on improved data and enhancing the staff voice. We are a partner on
         the EPSRC project Northern Power Inclusion Matters shaping a community that
         supports, drives and sustains greater equality for all, including traditionally under-
         represented groups.

         We regularly review and analyse our EDI data (figures 3.3a-c, 3.5) using staff groups to
         explore key issues, have grown the EDI team, added EDI to the PVC portfolio, and have
         established a new University Dean for EDI. We have an institutional EDI Committee and
         EDI Action Group and mandatory EDI staff training requiring renewal every three years.

 3.3.2   To tackle gender inequalities, including in promotion (figure 3.1), recruitment (figure 3.4)
         and to address our gender pay gap, we established an Athena SWAN Institutional Self-
         Assessment Team and a Gender Pay Gap Task Group. These groups published
         institutional action plans to drive inclusive practices including, a new recruitment toolkit
         designed to reduce bias; expansion of committee representation; revised progression
         route framework; and targets to increase the percentage of female staff applicants for
         jobs and promotion. As a result, our institutional Athena SWAN bronze award, held since
         2008, was renewed in 2020 and we have seen a reduction in our mean hourly gender
         pay gap from 27.7% in 2017 to 25.89% in 2020.




                                                                                               Page 9

         3.3.3   We are members of the Disability Confident Scheme and the Stonewall Global Diversity
                 Champions programme and display these affiliations on job adverts to attract the most
                 talented and diverse candidate pools. Despite a lack of diversity in the local area,
                 Lancaster’s number of BAME staff is above national average (15.7% against 14.5%
                 HESA 2018-19) however, BAME UK nationals are lower (7.5% against 10.1% HESA
                 2018-29). We will join the Race Equality Charter in April 2021 and our Strategic Race
                 Advisory Group will lead an action plan to oversee an increase in BAME staff numbers,
                 applications for roles and promotions.

         3.3.4   We operate a devolved EDI culture where departments are encouraged to be creative
                 and adaptive when implementing policy and solutions suitable for their disciplines (see
                 unit statements). We encourage departments to seek recognition for their own
                 commitments to advancing equality and half hold an Athena SWAN award (11 bronze, 2
                 silver). Our silver Athena SWAN award holders serve as peer mentors for others
                 applying for their first awards.

         3.3.5   Our approach builds strong commitment and engagement and enables the institution to
                 listen to the staff voice and has led to several initiatives derived from across our


                                                                                                  Page 10

         community. These have spread more widely, encouraging learning from area-to-area and
         supporting the enhancement of an institutional framework. Institutional actions to be
         explored include, extending FHM’s career-bridging scheme across Lancaster; extending
         the pilot of advertising ‘returner posts’ in STEMM and other under-represented subjects;
         and extending FST’s practice of offering academic returners a reduced and managed
         workload for the first year.

 3.3.6   An Equality Impact Assessment (EIA) was completed for our REF2021 Code of Practice,
         refreshed throughout the preparations and following submission. REF-specific EDI
         training was provided for all decision-making staff to ensure EDI considerations were
         integrated into all aspects of our preparations and through our REF committees.

 3.4.    Postgraduate research students (PGRs)
 3.4.1   Lancaster has seen significant growth in PGR numbers of 15% since 2013-14 (figure
         1.1). They are supported by our institutional Doctoral Academy, faculties, departments,
         and colleges. This has seen our graduates progressing to careers in higher education,
         public and private sector organisations.

 3.4.2   The Doctoral Academy works across the institution to offer high quality training
         opportunities and personal support. Each department has an academic Director of
         Postgraduate Research studies. They serve on related committees and as
         representatives within our Doctoral Academy to share best practice and provide advice
         on training opportunities amongst supervisors and administrators to optimise the PGR
         experience.

 3.4.3   Each PGR is assigned two supervisors and, if desired, an independent mentor. Since
         REF2014, we have instigated an online portal to record progress, supervisory meetings
         and upload associated documents. These are corroborated by a supervisor and ensure
         meetings take place at least every 28 days.

 4. Income, infrastructure and facilities

 4.1.    Income
 4.1.1   Lancaster has significantly increased research income since REF2014 (figure 4.1).
         Sustained growth was achieved by investment in our academic staff (3.2.1), supportive
         infrastructure (4.2) and facilities (4.3). Despite continual advancement, achievement of
         the strategic target of £45M by 2020 was disrupted due to Covid-19 (fig. 4.1 2019/20).
         We have also seen a significant growth in our in-kind income from £19.3M (REF2014) to
         £38M (REF2021).




                                                                                           Page 11

 Figure 4.1 Research income

 4.1.2                            We have seen growth in income across the institution (see unit statements) and
                                  maintained a similar funder profile despite the significant increase (figure 4.2). Through
                                  periodic departmental research reviews and the work of our research development team
                                  (4.2.5) we have ensured that support for grant applications is inclusive. Our male/female
                                  PI split for awards in 2019/20 was 62/38% in line with the gender profile (figure 3.3a).

 4.1.3                            University investment of £5.4M contributed to considerable success in awards (£65M) for
                                  funded, often interdisciplinary, doctoral training centres, including:
                                      AHRC North West Consortium – with HEIs across the Northwest and partners
                                       including BBC, MOSI and TATE Liverpool;
                                      ENVISION and STARS – NERC funded to develop leaders in environmental and
                                       soil sciences;
                                      EPSRC HighWire – a creative fusion between computer science, management and
                                       design;
                                      ESRC North West Social Science Doctoral Training Partnership;
                                      Material Social Futures – a cross-Research Institutes Leverhulme-funded
                                       programme focused on the environmental, sustainability and social behaviour
                                       impacts of new materials development;

                                                                                                                     Page 12
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
                        STOR-i – EPSRC-funded statistics and operational research with industrial
                         partners including BT, Met Office, National Nuclear Laboratory, Royal Mail and
                         Tesco;
                        STFC funded Lancaster Physics DTP and Cockcroft Institute DTP.

 4.2.               Infrastructure
 4.2.1              Our researchers are professionally supported through central services such as Research
                    and Enterprise Services (RES), Human Resources, Communications and Marketing,
                    Information Systems Services and the Library.

 4.2.2              RES provides central leadership and co-ordination of research, impact, enterprise and
                    engagement support. RES has expanded significantly since REF2014 through
                    reorganisation of faculty-based professional service staff and investment in additional
                    posts. The success of this approach can be seen in the increase of grant applications
                    and support of significantly increased awarded grants (figure 4.3). Our strategic approach
                    to increase large grants has seen a 270% increase in >£1M awards since REF2014.

 4.2.3              New RES posts include an Associate Director for Research Services, a Head of
                    Research Quality and Policy, three Impact Development Managers, three Impact Support
                    Officers and four Senior Research Development Managers. The latter maintain close
                    relationships with major funders and support strategically important applications.

 4.2.4              RES support for researchers includes:
                       Pre-award proposal development and costing;
                       Post-award administration (finance, contracts, ethics and clinical sponsorship);
                       Impact development;
                       Research commercialisation;
                       Consultancy;
                       Entrepreneurial training for staff and students.

 4.2.5              The pre-award development team proactively identify funding opportunities and provide
                    dedicated support for developing proposals (interpreting funder guidance, budget
                    suitability, partner liaison, internal approval and submission). The team is centrally-
                    managed but locally-deployed to target disciplinary support to staff.

 4.2.6                                 Lancaster’s communications team provides training and connects researchers with
                                       general audiences (media, social media and internal communications) to extend the
                                       reach of their work. In-house facilities include a TV (Globelynx) and radio (ISDN) studio
                                       and a response team focussed on connecting researchers with breaking news. We have
                                       the most frequently-used Globelynx studio of any UK University. In 2019-20, Lancaster’s
                                       researchers reached a global audience of >313M through 375 TV interviews, >185M
                                       through 374 radio interviews and >155M through 8,650 print/online articles. Of 85
                                       institutions using The Conversation in 2019-20, we ranked in the top ten for articles
                                       published with >4.5M reads.

 4.2.7                                 Our Library collaborates with researchers to actualise open research. They deliver open
                                       access services to maximise visibility and impact, including managing our institutional
                                       repository. They facilitate the management, sharing, archiving and preservation of
                                       research data to meet FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable,
                                       reusable). And drive impact and future collaboration via citation and altmetric analysis.
                                       The library is well engaged externally in future developments around scholarly
                                       communications, and its Data Conversations programme has been adopted by other
                                       HEIs internationally.

 4.3.                                  Facilities
 4.3.1                                 We have invested >£170M from multiple funding streams in research infrastructure since
                                       REF2014. Our commitment to providing world-class facilities for research, teaching and
                                       engagement is demonstrated by plans to spend a similar amount over the next 5 years.

 4.3.2                                 Examples of our institutional research investments include:
                                        £41M Health Innovation Campus (HIC): a national facility for innovation in healthcare
                                         comprising 8,000m2 of academic and innovation space and business accommodation;
                                        £20M in our library, including dedicated PGR/staff research space, a Digital
                                         Scholarship Lab and Open Research Lab and ESRC-funded SafePod for accessing
                                         highly-sensitive data;
                                        £8M for the Whitehouse Ruskin Collection – the largest collection of Ruskin’s works in
                                         the world purchased with financial support from a coalition of funders including the
                                         Heritage Lottery Fund;
                                        >£1.75M in secure data science infrastructure and >£1.5M in additive manufacturing
                                         facilities that led to £1.5M Secure Digitalisation University Enterprise Zone awarded
                                         by Research England.

                                                                                                                          Page 14

 4.3.3   Facilities supported by disciplinary investments include:
          £25M in extensive academic and collaboration spaces for our Management School;
          £28M in Chemistry including >£11M apparatus, laboratory and office space co-
           designed with industrial partners to embed impact and collaboration;
          £15M in Physics, including a suite of ultra-low noise laboratories providing the most
           advanced environments in the world to research quantum technologies;
          £12M in a new Engineering building to accommodate expansion and research
           specialisms including chemical engineering, particle accelerator technology and
           National Nuclear User Facilities;
          £5.7M in LICA (part of £13M Beyond Imagination Expanding Excellence in England
           Research England project) for new modular CAD studios, a new design and
           architecture workshop and visualisation laboratory.

 4.3.4   We also carry out world-leading research in the field throughout the world. This includes
         ecological research in Jari in the Brazilian Amazon since 2003 and imaging the radiation
         from nuclear reactors in Slovenia. We collaborate with universities, government
         departments, national laboratories and research institutes all over the world, for example,
         the Yayasan Sabah Group (Sabah Foundation) in Malaysia that manage one million
         hectares of tropical forest and three field stations in Borneo and, with government
         departments and arm’s-length bodies like the Environment Agency on the impact of land
         management interventions.

 4.3.5   Our researchers are involved in the ATLAS project at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN
         and contributed to the discovery of the Higgs Boson. Our particle physicists are carrying
         out award-winning experiments on neutrinos at JPARC and Fermilab. This was awarded
         the 2016 Breakthrough Prize for the discovery of neutrino oscillations. Lancaster leads
         the Cockcroft Institute for Accelerator Science and Technology, a STFC collaboration
         between the universities of Lancaster, Liverpool, Manchester and Strathclyde.

 4.3.6   To support our impact and engagement agenda we actively engage with Lancaster city.
         We have established a cultural partnership with Lancaster’s Dukes Theatre and opened
         a new academic space at Lancaster Castle to enhance research via dedicated seminars,
         particularly those relevant to local heritage. We have grown research in health and
         medicine since REF2014 and are enabling this by establishing a joint research office with
         our local NHS trust.

 4.3.7   In addition, Lancaster provides co-location of >50 organisations from sectors related to
         health, digital, cyber-security, clean growth, quantum technologies and smart materials in
         dedicated office/laboratory spaces embedded in academic departments. The focus of
         these facilities is to welcome innovative organisations of all sizes from the global
         community with the ability to grow and contribute to cutting-edge research. The physical
         proximity enabled by co-location supports collaborative research (funded via the
         Research Councils or InnovateUK), research focussed student or postgraduate
         placements and Lancaster graduate recruitment to these organisations. The opening of
         the HIC (4.3.2) will further enhance these research collaborations; key successes already
         include Quantum Base (Quantum Security), LiNa Energy (Battery Technology) and
         Yordas Group (Environmental Regulatory Services).
