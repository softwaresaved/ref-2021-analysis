 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy

 1.1. Overview

 The University of Manchester (UoM) UOA3 comprises 125.52 FTE staff, covering Allied Health
 Professions, Dentistry, Nursing, and Pharmacy, with core strengths in: (1) underpinning basic
 and translational science and methodology; (2) applied health and social care research; and (3)
 policy and population-health research. The unit encapsulates basic, translational, clinical and
 applied health and social care scientists. As individual disciplines and via collaborative working
 we have produced responsive and impactful research across the translational pathway. The
 submission evidences how our ‘One Manchester’ approach (Section 1.1.1) is at the centre of our
 environment and has resulted in positive impact on the population in general, as well as for
 specific groups of service users, health and social care professionals, the academic community,
 and industry. Deliverables and metrics that evidence our overall excellence in this REF period
 are summarised in Figure 1.

 1.1.1. UOA3 within the ‘One Manchester’ approach

 In 2016, the devolution of the health and social care budget (£6bn pa) to Greater Manchester
 (GM) catalysed the creation of a unified, integrated, health science and innovation system:
 Health Innovation Manchester (HInM). HInM unites the GM health and social care systems
 (Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, MAHSC; re-designated by NIHR for a further five
 years in 2020) and the Academic Health Science Network (AHSN), local academic partners,
 local industry and patients/public, in a ‘One Manchester’ approach. UOA3 researchers are at the
 heart of this approach (Figure 2), listening to the needs of the local NHS, social care system and
 the local population, and mounting appropriate research responses. HInM then enables rapid
 deployment, where appropriate, of cost-effective innovation at scale and pace across GM, and
 nationally for innovation adopted by the AHSN.

 1.2. Research Areas

 Below we detail the research areas represented by this submission, evidencing activity with
 outputs and key grants.

 Allied Health Professions (research staff 25.2 FTE)

 We address topics including: sensory disorders, healthy ageing, and communication and
 development.

 Audiology at UoM is the UK’s largest audiology research group, with 13 research-focused staff
 at lecturer level and above. We conduct a broad range of research from the physiology of
 hearing and its impairment (Plack Neuropsychologia 2014,39071756), noise induced hearing
 loss (Kluk Hearing Res 2017,61948372), and hearing and cognition (Dawes PLoS ONE
 2014,39344043), to auditory devices (Saunders Ear Hearing 2016,164510534), advanced
 diagnostics (Schlittenlacher Trends Hear 2018,DOI:10.1177/2331216518788215), and
 pediatric audiology (Dillon Pediatrics 2017,132976941). The research group constitutes the
 Manchester Centre for Audiology and Deafness (ManCAD) led by Munro, who also leads the
 Hearing Health Theme (£4.5m) in the NIHR Manchester BRC (£28.5m), bringing together
 researchers from audiology, speech and language therapy, genomics, health psychology, and
 engineering. Audiology staff contribute to the Horizon 2020 SENSE-Cog programme (€6.5m),
 investigating links between sensory impairment and cognitive decline.

 Early Language Development develop models of typically developing children’s early language
 and communicative development and study children’s linguistic environment and its role in
 supporting language acquisition (Polišenská J Speech Lang Hear R 2016,64558530). We
 include the Parents and Children Together project (led by Burgoyne); a long-term early
 language teaching programme involving 47 nursery schools, and approximately 450 families, in
 Manchester and Lancashire.

 Language Impairment investigate the causes and associated difficulties of language
 impairment and have the UK’s largest longitudinal study of language disorders from childhood to
 early adulthood (The Manchester Language Study, started in 1995 and led by Conti-Ramsden,
 following 242 children from age seven years until their mid-20s; Conti-Ramsden PLoS One
 2016,50810425). We also conduct intervention research on pragmatic language impairment
 (Adams Res Dev Disabil 2015,39051728).

 Optometry and Vision Sciences improve our understanding of the structure and function of the
 human visual system and translate new knowledge into useful clinical tests, devices and

                                                                                           Page 5
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 commercial products (Aslam Am J Ophthamol 2018,64635835). The Eurolens Group (led by
 Morgan with service and contract industrial research support >£8m) specializes in improving
 contact lens performance and studying the physiology of the tear film and the ocular surface
 (Maldano-Codina Cornea 2020,133768288).

 Dentistry (research staff 16.8 FTE)

 We undertake research encompassing the translational pathway, with demonstrable impact on
 the delivery and quality of dental services and clinical care.

 Basic Dental Science: Our craniofacial genetic research uses the latest genomics technologies
 (Bobola: PI on MRC and BBSRC projects totalling £3m over the REF period). We generate and
 integrate data on chromatin states, occupancy of transcriptional regulators (ChIP-seq) and
 transcriptional profiles (RNA-seq), to decipher transcriptional networks that guide apparently
 similar blocks of tissue into forming anatomical structures such as the face, ear and heart
 (Bobola Development 2016,51323477). Research in our laboratories uses systems-level
 approaches to delineate gene regulatory networks underlying development of the lip and palate,
 and dissects how their modification relates to the pathogenesis of cleft lip and palate (Dixon J
 PLoS Genet 2017,62293836). Our biomaterials research has developed novel biomaterial
 formulations based on nanotechnology, exploration of molecular interactions between collagen
 and adhesive organic monomers and adhesive interactions with hard dental tissues and bone
 (Silikas Dent Mater 2019 DOI: 10.1016/j.dental.2019.08.102. We host the editorial base for
 Dental Materials (Watts, Silikas).

 Health Services: Our research includes public health and primary care, caries and diagnostic
 research, oral radiology and imaging, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthodontics, and
 management/care of cleft lip and palate. Our research has improved oral health by contributing
 to the oral health evidence base to inform health policy, healthcare planning and clinical care of
 patients (Thompson Antibiotics 2020,176457873; Worthington Health Technol Assess
 2020,85376916; Tickle J Dent Res 2015,39061069). Our health services research has received
 over £8.5m NIHR funding for projects active over the REF period. The research theme
 incorporates the editorial base of Cochrane Oral Health (led by Clarkson, Glenny; previously
 Worthington; £1.1m infrastructure funding 2014-2020), which has also established the Global
 Evidence Ecosystem for Oral Health (GEEOH). Our researchers produce trustworthy evidence
 that is globally adaptable to end-users’ needs. Our research also utilises data held by NHS
 Business Services Authority, part of NHS Digital, either wholly, or to support primary research
 (LOTUS: Pretty £330k; Reflect: Tickle £2.1m).

 Nursing (research staff 36.1 FTE)

 We enjoy an international reputation for multi-disciplinary applied health and social care
 research.

 Nursing includes healthy ageing and palliative care research. Todd leads the NIHR Older
 People and Frailty Policy Research Unit (£5m): Hawley-Hague Prog Cardiovasc Dis
 2019,84957733; Stanmore BMC Med 2019,8552787. Keady leads the Neighbourhoods and
 Dementia NIHR/ESRC Study (£4.2m). Grande’s research supports improved end-of-life care
 (Grande Patient Educ Couns 2014,39061166). Cullum and Dumville undertake epidemiological
 and translational research on wounds and their complications including large RCTs (NIHR HTA:
 £1.9m), a programme in the Manchester BRC and Cullum leads Cochrane Wounds (Dumville
 NIHR Journals Lib (HTA) 2014,39060387, Cullum NEJM 2018,83397628; Briggs NIHR
 Journals Lib 2015,64615722). Bee and Lovell lead internationally recognised mental health

 community and stakeholders. Young leads the national prospective longitudinal study of d/Deaf
 young people in the UK (National Deaf Children’s Society £600k). Rogers NIHR Journals Lib
 2017,63971316.

 Social Care and Society encompasses the NIHR School for Social Care Research. Their work
 includes research in the criminal and social justice system: Robinson Health Social Care Com
 2018,135172250; Clarkson Aging Mental Health 2016,51483626.

 Pharmacy (research staff 47.4 FTE)

 Pharmacy-based research encompasses most aspects of the drug development translational
 pipeline from drug synthesis through to drug usage. Groupings are thematic, with staff moving
 from one to another depending on the project. Research income (accounting for credit share)
 was £34m in the period.

 Patients: Diagnosis and Therapy focus on our understanding of disease biology to identify
 molecular targets suitable for therapeutic intervention (Finegan Oncogene 2020,174614833;
 Williams Mol Cancer Ther 2014,39330995), develop clinically relevant models of disease to
 assess drug efficacy (Neill Int J Neuropsychopharmacology 2014,39062308; McBain J Invest
 Dermatol 2017,63048674), and find biological markers that can predict the development of a
 disease, its diagnosis and its response to therapy (Nicolaou J Pathology 2019,84607212;
 Finegan Cancer Res 2016,39332147). Research awards total ~£9m, examples include: McBain
 (£365k Unilever), Nicolaou (£409k, Unilever).

 Medicines: Design and Delivery develop new, clinically viable therapies, integrating structural,
 analytical, computational and synthetic chemistry with expertise in target biology (Butterworth J
 Med Chem 2020,170122962; Freeman Chem Sci 2020,178138437) and understand how and
 why therapies work, by using omics, imaging techniques and computer modelling (Williams
 Theranostics 2017,61959481; Nicolaou Arthritis Res Ther 2019,102777680; Bryce
 Biomacromolecules 2015,39054796). This group hosts the Nanotechnology in Medicine network

 nanomaterials and nanotechnologies, including graphene and other 2D materials, to provide
 solutions for unmet clinical challenges (Vranic Nat. Nanotechnol 2017,85045010). The group
 includes two Centres: The North West Centre for Advanced Drug Delivery (NoWCADD, led by
 Lawrence), which translates drug delivery science into treatments for serious and life-
 threatening conditions (Tirella Mol Pharmaceutics 2017,64347796), and the Centre for Applied
 Pharmacokinetic Research (CAPKR, led by Rostami-Hodjegan) studies how genetics, lifestyle
 and disease can affect the therapeutic and adverse effects of drugs (Scotcher CPT:
 Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol 2020,177331868). Research awards total ~£17m, examples
 include Aarons (£1.5m AstraZeneca Ltd), Rostami-Hodjegan (£127k Simcyp Ltd).

 Drug Usage and Pharmacy Practice improve medicine use and safety, informing pharmacy
 policy and workforce behaviour. Ashcroft leads the Centre for Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug
 Safety medication safety theme of the NIHR GM Patient Safety Translational Research Centre
 where they develop, evaluate and implement new models and systems of healthcare practice
 ensuring safe and effective medicines-use (Steinke BMJ Open 2020,178187170; Phipps Arch

 1.3. Structure

 1.3.1. UOA3 within University and Faculty structures




 Figure 3. UOA3 staff locations within the Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health


 UOA3 sits within the Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health (Figure 3), one of three University
 Faculties (FBMH, Science and Engineering, Humanities). FBMH was created in 2016 by
 integrating the Faculty of Life Sciences and Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences to facilitate
 translational research and greater interdisciplinary working, especially between basic and clinical
 sciences. UoM has invested ~£128m in new interdisciplinary research institutes (REF5a, Section
 2iii). At a university level, further interdisciplinary working is showcased by the forward-facing
 Research Beacons (Advanced Materials, Cancer, Energy, Industrial Biotechnology, and Global
 Inequalities). The Beacons showcase UoM’s pioneering discoveries, interdisciplinary
 collaboration, and cross-sector partnerships that are tackling some of the biggest questions
 facing the planet. Within these Beacons UOA3 staff play major roles, e.g. Kostarelos, Tirelli in
 Materials; Williams in Cancer; Lavender in Global Health.

 advanced materials), and the Sir Henry Royce Institute, spans Faculties to create an unrivalled
 opportunity to develop and apply new advanced materials to healthcare. The Nanomedicine Lab
 (led by Kostarelos) contributes to the Graphene Flagship, with a €1b budget funded by the
 European Commission. UoM is one of the largest academic partners and Kostarelos sits on the
 Flagship Project Management Board and leads on Biomedical Technologies, focussing on
 developing neural implants and bioelectronics-based therapeutic elements for specific clinical
 outcomes in neurology, ophthalmology and surgical oncology. Kostarelos is the Director of the
 2D Materials for Next Generation Healthcare Technologies, a five-year cross-faculty programme
 funded by EPSRC (£5.3m). Outputs co-authored with Faculty of Science and Engineering
 include: Pluen Mol Pharmaceutics 2020,158115766; Lawrence Langmuir 2019,158672842.
 Examples of collaborations in the Faculty of Humanities (FH) include The Manchester Institute
 for Collaborative Research on Ageing (MICRA) which undertakes cross-disciplinary research
 addressing the major challenges posed by ageing populations. Marshall chairs MICRA’s
 management board and Todd co-leads MICRA project Prevent IT, which gained EU funding to
 develop and evaluate behaviour change interventions with older adults. Outputs co-authored
 with FH include: Hawley-Hague Pro Cardiovasc Dis 2019, 84957733; Hicks Sociol Rev 2020,

 Support for cross-faculty translational research

 Funding for this comes from rolling annual awards from the Wellcome Trust (ISSF consolidator
 awards), MRC (Confidence in Concept, CIC) and the UoM Strategic Research Infrastructure
 Fund (£6m pa).

 •   The ISSF Awards (£50k) aim to consolidate existing activity in emerging areas of strength,
     providing funding for multi-disciplinary projects. UOA3 staff awarded ISSF include Bee,
     Bichenkova, Bryce, Lewis, Neill.
 •   The University Interdisciplinary Research Pump-prime Competition awards funding to
     promote successful interdisciplinary research (8-10 annually of £10k-£50k). For example, in
     UOA3 this led Complex Wounds Manchester to develop point of care tests to predict wound
     healing, involving collaboration between Nursing (Cullum, Dumville); Pharmacy (McBain);
     Advanced Materials (Cartmell UOA12); Materials Engineering (Lu, Waigh UOA9); and
     Biological Physics (Reid, Wong UOA1). Other UOA3 staff to benefit from University of
     Manchester Research Institute awards include Brooks, Burden, Bussy, Kostarelos,
     Nagington, Nicolaou, Stanmore, Tirelli, Tully.
 •   The MRC CIC scheme awards fund proof-of-concept/feasibility studies. UOA3 researchers
     have benefitted from this funding and have generated preliminary data resulting in
     subsequent awards, e.g. Finegan (Friends of Rosie £67k, CRUK £82k).
 •   Further institutional investment in UOA3 comes from the University Endowments Project
     Research Fund (£1.7m), used to build targeted capacity in nanomedicine by recruiting ECRs
     and providing support over a five-year period. The aim is to diversify the nanomedicine
     research portfolio into specific scientific and therapeutic areas (cell biology, Vranic;
     oncology, Hadjidemetriou; neuroscience, Wykes; inflammation, Bussy).




                                                                                              Page 9

 1.4. Delivering research success since REF2014

 1.4.1. REF2014 Objective 1: Increase and diversify our research funding

 Overall research income increased from £42.7m in REF2014 to £99.7m in REF2021 (Figure 4;
 expanded in Section 3.1). Our funding has diversified particularly in global health, receiving
 £6.5m from the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF). We have increased funding from UK
 government and industry, e.g. we were awarded an STFC grant (>£1m) for access to analytical
 neutron beams in the UK and Europe (UKRI ‘income-in-kind’).




 Figure 4. Research income in REF2021 compared with REF2014 across six categories
 (excluding income-in-kind)


 1.4.2. REF2014 Objective 2: Recruit and develop talented researchers

 We continue to promote, identify and recruit talented researchers. In the period we have
 promoted 54 staff (compared to 38 in REF2014), including 16 to Professor and 26 to Senior
 Lecturer/Reader. We have recruited six staff to Professor, eight to Senior Lecturer/Reader, 10 to
 Lecturer/Fellow and supported our researchers to gain prestigious fellowships (Section 2.1).


 1.4.3. REF2014 Objective 3: Increase collaboration and prioritisation

 Collaboration with local NHS and patients

 UOA3’s collaborations with local NHS are exemplified by successful funding of large research
 centres resulting from partnerships within the ‘One Manchester’ approach (Section 1.1.1). Our
 success depended on our collaborative and responsive ethos in several research prioritisation
 exercises, some supported by the James Lind Alliance, including End of Life Care (Grande),




                                                                                           Page 10
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 Dentistry (Glenny), Wounds (Cullum), Mental and Physical Health (Lovell), Early Intervention
 Services (Renwick) and more efficient clinical use of biological therapies (Ogungbenro).

 Global health in low and middle-income countries

 UoM’s infrastructure has enabled growth in our international collaborations. UOA3 researchers
 increased funding and impact in global health in low and middle-income countries. Examples
 include:

 •   Lavender leads a WHO Collaborating Centre, established programmes of research in sub-
     Saharan Africa, and was awarded an NIHR Global Health Research Group in Stillbirth (£2m).
 •   Young leads an AHRC/MRC GCRF Global Public Health Partnership Grant/ Global Impact
     Accelerator Grant (£222k) on enhancing resilient Deaf youth in South Africa.
 •   Robinson secured a GCRF grant ‘The South Asia Self-Harm Initiative’ (£4m) strengthening
     research capability in UK, India, and Pakistan.
 •   The Gates Foundation supports Aarons and Ogungbenro to build research capacity in
     pharmacometrics research in sub-Saharan Africa.
 •   A Newton-funded workshop (Lovell) enhanced research capacity for early-career
     researchers from the UK and Indonesia; resulted in awards: Lovell/Brooks (MRC £126k),
     Bee (MRC/DFID/NIHR £350k), Renwick (DFID/MRC/NIHR/Wellcome £148k).
 •   Edge Protecting Youth from Interpersonal Violence via Implementation of the Strengthening
     Families Programme in Panama (MRC £363k).

 Examples of outputs in collaboration with low and middle-income countries include: Lavender
 PLoS Medicine 2018,84781681; Young Medical Humanities 2019,132444619; Bee Res Involv
 Engagem 2019,DOI:10.1186/s40900-019-0161-3.

 National and International collaborations

 We collaborate widely, nationally and internationally (Section 4).


 1.4.4. REF2014 Objective 4: Enhance academic and societal impact

 UOA3 have demonstrated significant academic and societal impact (Section 1.6 and Section 4).
 We have maintained our publication output, with eligible staff publishing 3119 papers 2014-2020
 compared to 2098 in REF2014 (Scopus 14/01/21). In terms of quality, 20.5% of our papers
 (639/3119) appear in the top 10% citation percentile (field weighted). Rostami-Hodjegan (2016)
 and Kostarelos (2018) were named in the top 10 highly cited researchers in the cross-field
 category (clarivate.com).


 1.5. Objectives for the next five years

 Our objectives are aligned and reflect our ambitions across all four Research Areas.


 1.5.1. REF2021 Objective 1: Expand societal impact by maximising translation of our
      basic science into health and social care

 Advancing translation and implementation of research in UOA3 (Section 1.2) will drive positive
 societal impact. The impact of our research is enhanced via utilisation and expansion of the
 networks in our ‘One Manchester’ approach. We will exploit these opportunities and leverage the
 maximal impact from our research.




                                                                                         Page 11
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 We will:

 •   Develop, evaluate and implement five innovations addressing priorities for GM that have
     national and international impact.
 •   Double the number of researchers with translational/implementation expertise.
 •   Increase translational funding from NIHR, UKRI, charities and industry by 25%.


 1.5.2. REF2021 Objective 2: Enhance research co-production and collaboration locally,
      nationally, and internationally

 We will expand our research with a breadth of stakeholders focussing on boosting links with
 business engagement and offering targeted support to increase industry-academic funding
 across UOA3 Areas. We will increase co-production activity to underpin and shape our research
 locally in GM, nationally, and in global health.

 We will:

 •   Increase interdisciplinary grants with practitioners, service users, industrial partners, and
     other stakeholders by 25%.
 •   Double the number of PhDs collaborating with industry.
 •   Increase the proportion of grant funding focusing on health and social care issues in lower
     and middle-income countries by 25%.


 1.5.3. REF2021 Objective 3: Develop and evaluate new digital health technologies to
      improve health, person-centred care, and the economic sustainability of health and
      care services

 One of our emerging interdisciplinary strengths, with opportunities for future research growth,
 lies in new digital health technologies. Digital innovation for improvements in economic
 productivity and innovation, health, social, cyber security and ethical standards in data usage, is
 driven through our Digital Futures multidisciplinary community (REF5a, Section 2iv). UoM is one
 of 13 university partners of the Turing Institute, the UK’s national Institute for Data Science and
 AI, and is home to the Centre for Health Informatics and the new Christabel Pankhurst Institute
 for Health Technology from where we conduct world-leading research and translation into health
 informatics and digital health technologies. There are Digital Health themes in both the NIHR
 ARC-GM and Hearing Health in the Manchester BRC. We will use our presence in HInM to
 exploit digital health technologies; to evaluate ways in which these new technologies can
 improve health, deliver person-centred care, and improve the efficiency of the health and care
 system.

 We will:

 •   Increase the proportion of interdisciplinary research grants with a significant digital health
     technology component by 25%.
 •   Increase the proportion of grants conducted in collaboration with industry partners in the field
     of digital and new technology by 20%.
 •   Increase the impact of our use of digital technologies on health and social care.


 1.5.4. REF2021 Objective 4: Recruit and develop talented researchers

 We will continue to identify and recruit talented researchers who align to our priorities creating
 capacity, a critical mass and sustainability for interdisciplinary working. We will achieve this by


                                                                                               Page 12
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 our internal investments including presidential fellows and our UOA3 specific development and
 support mechanisms (Section 2.1).

 We will:

 •   Increase numbers of externally and internally funded academic and clinical academic training
     schemes, doctoral and post-doctoral fellowships by 25%.
 •   Increase the number of ECRs holding external grant funding by 15%.


 1.6. Impact strategy

 1.6.1. Approach to enabling and facilitating impact

 Our institutional statement (REF5a, Section 2iv) outlines our focus on impact, where we were
 first in Europe in the 2018 THE University Impact Rankings. Networks and departments across
 UoM offer impact-related support and advice, e.g. the Knowledge Exchange Team, the Business
 Engagement Support Team, UoM Innovation Factory and Public Engagement at Manchester.
 Impact is aided by Policy@Manchester (which connects researchers with policy makers). UOA3
 researchers, with Policy@Manchester and the Library, deliver 1-day workshops (75-100
 participants) on ‘Enhancing Research Reach and Impact,’ with external sessions delivered by
 Kudos, The Conversation, and the Westminster Parliamentary Engagement Team.

 UOA3 co-production starts by collaborating to get the research question right, and continues
 through to mobilise new knowledge generated, followed by dissemination and implementation.
 Our co-production partners include patients and the public, health and care commissioners,
 practitioners, policymakers, and industry. UOA3 are submitting nine impact case studies and
 evidence impact in three key areas:

 •   Health and social care: Cullum/Dumville (IC1), Young (IC2), Aslam (IC3)
 •   Patients and the community: Grande (IC4)
 •   Industry, government, and policy makers: Rostami-Hodjegan (IC5), Todd (IC6), Pretty
     (IC7), Glenny (IC8), Worthington (IC9).


 1.6.2. Engagement and co-production with health and social care

 UOA3 engages with health and social care organisations that support co-production of research.
 These links are strengthened by three professorial appointments with NHS Trusts: Briggs,
 Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (MFT) co-funds her Florence Nightingale
 Foundation Chair in Clinical Nursing post; Keady, Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS
 Foundation Trust (GMMH); and Yorke, Christie NHS Foundation Trust until 2020 when she was
 appointed Chief Nurse retaining 20% FTE with UoM. Yorke founded the Christie Patient-
 Centered Research and developed the Christie Clinical Academic Pathway supporting combined
 clinical and research pathways for nurses and allied health professionals. Duncombe (Category
 C), Chief Pharmacist at the Christie, has facilitated our research on efficient and optimum dosing
 of individual antibody treatments (Ogungbenro Clin Pharmacol Ther 2017,64346561). This work
 demonstrated NHS cost savings due to more efficient use of expensive antibodies. Lenney
 (Category C), Chief Nurse for MFT, developed structures to support co-production of research,
 research capacity, establishing the MFT Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health Professional
 research group and the Manchester Wound Care Group (Lenney, Cullum, Dumville). MFT
 awarded Briggs £619k to support research capacity for nurses, midwives and allied health
 professionals (2017-2022), funding 12 pre-doctoral, three doctoral and six postdoctoral
 fellowships. Briggs cements this collaboration by leading on capacity development for the NIHR
 ARC-GM. Burden has a 50% appointment with Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust.



                                                                                           Page 13
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 Examples of engagement and co-production include:

 •   Cullum, Dumville with the NHS improved care and outcomes for people with venous leg
     ulcers, increasing the efficiency of NHS care (IC1).
 •   Young engaged deaf people to enable the introduction of British Sign Language-centred
     health and social care (IC2).
 •   Aslam formed a spinout and collaborated with industry to improve compliance of asthma
     medication use in children (IC3).


 1.6.3. Engagement and co-production with patients and the community

 Researchers in UOA3 support the central role of patient/public involvement and engagement in
 shaping and guiding research. Well-planned, resourced and meaningful involvement
 necessitates that service users and carers achieve sufficient confidence, knowledge and skills.
 Examples include:

 •   Grande developed, tested and implemented an intervention for family carers to provide end-
     of-life care (IC4).
 •   Young developed training for British Sign Language users, highlighted by NIHR as
     exemplary practice.
 •   Keady established the ‘Open Doors Research Group’ (the largest group of people with
     dementia and their carer’s as co-researchers in England) producing three films for Dementia
     Action Week, 2018.
 •   Bee developed and delivered research methods courses for users/carers of mental health
     services and developed into a co-produced book (2018, ISBN:9781526136527e).
 •   Lovell co-developed and co-delivered, with service users and carers, care planning to 1000
     mental health professionals and was awarded the 2015 NIHR Mental Health Research
     Network for outstanding carer involvement and the NIHR 2017 ‘Let’s Get Digital’ award for a
     co-produced video.
 •   Couth with Colt Foundation funding (£152k) collaborated with musicians at the Royal
     Northern College of Music to determine effects of loud music exposure on hearing ability,
     and to find ways to promote the use of hearing protection.


 1.6.4. Engagement and co-production with industry

 Strong business engagement is promoted and supported by FBMH, with business engagement
 leads at faculty, school, and divisional levels. Represented in this submission are UOA3
 researchers with strong industrial partnerships. We have benefitted significantly from Innovate
 UK funding with 10 grants totalling £3.3m and other substantive independent industry funding
 (Section 3.1). Examples include:

 •   Rostami-Hodjegan, Galetin (Deputy Director) lead CAPKR, which is a consortium of
     industrial pharma (currently eight companies paying up to £100k pa for membership) to carry
     out pre-competitive research, and have pioneered the concept of ‘Precision Dosing’ (IC5).
 •   NoWCADD is a partnership between Pharmacy and AstraZeneca (£1.5m), set up to create
     collaborative R&D programmes with research groups at UoM and across the global scientific
     community to translate emerging drug delivery science into value medicines (Lawrence
     MicroSun, Microfluidics Scale-Up of Nanoformulations; 2018-2020; £225k).
 •   Stanmore with MIRA Rehab developed and trialled Exergames (physiotherapy video
     games). Funding from NHS Trusts, MIRA Rehab, Burdett and UoM (£704k) has led to
     implementation in >150 clinics with >40,000 patients.
 •   Burden partners with pharma companies (£2m) producing Teduglutide, now marketed by
     Takeda as Revestive, to help people with intestinal failure to more effectively absorb fluid
     and nutrients.


                                                                                          Page 14
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 •   Dentistry has a 50-year collaboration with Colgate-Palmolive (Pretty) providing infrastructure
     funding (£200k pa) for primary research and funding PhDs.
 •   McBain has a rolling 15-year funding history from Colgate to underpin research into biofilms
     (£561k).
 •   Morgan leads the Eurolens Research Group with industrial support (>£8m) improving
     contact lens performance.
 •   Neill leads b-neuro. Industrial support (£762k) develops and utilizes murine models of
     cognitive deficits to evaluate novel therapeutic strategies.
 •   The Hearing Health theme of the BRC hosts the UK’s only Hearing Device Research Centre,
     led by Stone and Saunders, working with industry to drive interventions for hearing loss and
     translate new technologies into the NHS, including hearing aid fitting procedures (NAL-NLII
     and CAM2) and the ‘TEN’ test for diagnosing cochlear dead regions (£170k industry
     funding).


 1.6.5. Engagement and co-production with government and policy makers

 UOA3 work with policy makers ensuring our research has a clear line-of-sight to policy.

 •   Todd works with policy makers and guideline developers showing how their research has
     transformed falls prevention services (IC6).
 •   Dentistry works with international guideline developers, Clinical Dental Officers, PHE and
     other stakeholders to close the loop between new research evidence and improved care.
     Over the past four years, Manchester has hosted three Oral Health Research & Policy Think
     Tanks in collaboration with the Chief Dental Officer for England. The Think Tank in 2019
     highlighted key research findings and the translation of findings into a policy framework.
 •   Pretty evidences how, with NHS commissioners, researchers developed and implemented
     an online referral management system (IC7).
 •   Glenny shows how, working with national and international guideline developers, our
     research underpins recommendations and has optimised patient care for preventing dental
     caries (IC8).
 •   Worthington synthesises evidence that has influenced care provision and resulted in
     significant improvements in the oral care and management of disease in medically
     compromised patients (IC9).
 •   Rostami-Hodjegan, Galetin (IC5) have changed drug development policy in the Food and
     Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency.
 •   Stratford (Nat Rev Clin Oncol 2016,DOI:10.1038/nrclinonc.2016.79) and Williams (Clin
     Cancer Res 2019,DOI:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-2466) have contributed to developing
     international regulatory science and policy for the use of new medicines in combination with
     radiotherapy.


 1.7. Open research

 1.7.1. Principles and support

 UOA3 are committed to open research and benefit from UoM and faculty initiatives to promote
 open research (REF5a, Section 2v). This includes: pre-registration; transparent research
 methodology; public availability and reusability of research data and analysis code; public
 accessibility and transparency of research communication; and using web-based tools
 facilitating collaboration. To support these expectations, we provide:

 •   Guidance and training for all researchers, from expert teams including the Library, Research
     and Business Engagement, and the Open Research Working Group.
 •   Access to systems facilitating open research, including Pure, the Library’s OA
     Gateway, ORCID, and the UoM Data Repository.

                                                                                            Page 15
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 •   Support for sustainable open access options include UKRI (£1.2m) and Wellcome (£170k)
     block grants and UoM’s Open Access Fund (£300k).

 UOA3 staff are committed to the UoM’s open research principles evidenced by:

 •   100% of submitted staff have an ORCID identifier.
 •   90% of papers published since April 2016 are open access.
 •   New commitment to pre-register >90% of future studies (with exceptions only for commercial
     confidentiality).
 •   Our clinical studies are pre-registered.


 1.7.2. Open Research Working Group

 The University-wide Open Research Working Group established by Stewart (UOA4) and Jay
 (UOA11) (Plack is a core member) meets quarterly to arrange training events and workshops
 around open and reproducible research. Stewart (UOA4) represents Manchester within the UK
 Reproducibility Network while the Manchester node forms part of a broader NW Open Research
 Hub, connecting equivalent groups at Lancaster, Keele, Sheffield, Manchester Metropolitan
 University, Leeds, and Chester. The School of Health Sciences hosts a fortnightly open science
 journal club (RepoducibiliTea), for all staff and students.


 1.8. Research integrity

 UOA3 are committed to the highest standards of research conduct and integrity, reducing
 research waste, and improving research quality. The Vice President oversees research
 governance ethics and integrity (RGEI) supported by an Academic Director and a dedicated
 Office of RGEI.

 All researchers and staff supporting research are required to conduct their research and
 disseminate findings according to UoM policies and Code of Good Research Conduct (REF5a,
 Section 2v). All individuals undertaking research are required to take an online course on
 research integrity and data protection. UOA3 staff are involved in research integrity policy.
 Glenny was a member of a working group (with representatives from Lancet, JAMA, BMJ, World
 Medical Editors Assoc) developing core competencies for Scientific Editors.


 1.8.1. Studies involving human participation

 Research conducted by UOA3 staff or students involving human participants must receive
 approval from a recognised research ethics committee, either the University Research Ethics
 Committee (UREC) or HRA approval / NHS REC. UREC has 32 meetings a year, and instigated
 an expedited response for COVID-19 studies.


 1.8.2. Animal research

 Animal research is subject to the Concordat on Openness in Animal Research. This pledges
 transparency and public engagement on research involving animals. We have a culture of care
 among our staff working with animals, based on a strong collaborative environment and a
 shared collegiate philosophy.




                                                                                        Page 16

 2. People

 2.1. Staffing strategy and staff development

 UOA3 researchers benefit from a continuum of researcher development to support progression
 along clinical and non-clinical researcher career pathways, providing co-ordinated support from
 pre-PhD to senior academic research leadership, strategically aligned to our Faculty Research
 and Innovation Strategy (REF5a, Section 3).

 UOA3 academics are provided with comprehensive support through Faculty researcher
 development teams and UoM’s professional services including library, careers, research IT, and
 staff learning and development. UoM has been a signatory of the Concordat to Support the
 Career Development of Researchers since 2009, alongside our concordat implementation plan
 to continually enhance policies and practice overseen by the University Research Staff Strategy
 Group (URSSG).

 URSSG have developed open-ended contracts carrying additional benefits for researchers with
 four years or more continuous service. In addition to the statutory notice period of three months,
 this includes an extra three months’ salary. Research staff benefit from a redeployment scheme
 (being registered for a further six months) bridging gaps between funding. UoM developed a
 statement of expectations for research staff supporting 10 days development per annum. We
 have a robust induction, including our online Research Staff Handbook, the Researcher
 Development Planner, and the sector-wide Researcher Development Framework as a tool to
 map and guide career development.

 UoM structures facilitate integration into the research culture at divisional, school, faculty and
 university levels. UOA3 staff attend an annual Research Staff Conference, a broadening career
 horizons ‘Pathways’ event for PhDs and research staff, ‘Writefest’ (a month of events devoted to
 supporting academic writing, publishing and grant writing), and an accredited ‘Researchers into
 Management’ development programme. All staff and PGRs have access to the Manchester Gold
 mentoring schemes and coaching; the further education and external training fund; our ‘Investing
 in Success’ funding scheme; the International Conference Fund and Research Collaboration
 Research Staff Funding Scheme. We have a policy for research/sabbatical leave which includes
 both fixed-term and part-time staff. Academic staff from probation onwards are encouraged to
 have a mentor, and training/mentorship needs are identified and monitored during annual
 performance and development reviews (P&DRs). To enhance effectiveness we have an online
 system. In 2020, 99% of UOA3 staff had a P&DR.

 academic posts including: Cooke, Finnegan, Hancock, Harris, Pedley, Phipps, Price O,
 Ogungbenro, Tirella, Scotcher, Latif, Jacobs (8 female / 4 male).


 2.1.3. Training and development

 UOA3 researchers enjoy a range of training and development opportunities. The Centre for
 Academic and Researcher Development (CARD) delivers training, development, mentoring and
 coaching for clinical/non-clinical researchers, academics and NHS partners. CARD delivers the
 new academics and fellows programme, leading to Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.
 CARD convenes the Faculty Research Staff Representatives Forum which promotes the
 interests of clinical and non-clinical research staff ensuring their training needs are met and
 works with the N8 research partnership to enhance their experiences.

 UOA3’s early clinical academic researchers have access to all training and development
 courses and are supported through the Manchester Integrated Clinical Academic Training
 (ICAT) programme, hosted by MAHSC. ICAT facilitates and supports the academic development
 of both undergraduate and postgraduate clinical trainees who aspire to follow a clinical academic
 career path. ICAT is managed as a partnership between UoM and Health Education North West
 and in close liaison with the NIHR Trainees Coordinating Centre, which oversees ‘Integrated
 Academic Training’.

 The Fellowship Academy

 UoM’s Fellowship Academy identifies and supports clinical and non-clinical researchers to gain
 externally funded pre- and post-doctoral fellowships, providing support through CV clinics, mock
 interviews, pump-prime funding and the Presidential Fellowships, providing three years’ salary to
 secure external fellowships.




                                                                                          Page 18
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 The Fellowship Academy runs events and workshops attended by funders including MRC,
 Wellcome, CRUK, BHF, BBSRC, and NIHR. The Academy manages the MRC Skills
 Development Fellowships and the Wellcome Clinical PhD Programme (4ward North Clinical PhD
 Academy). The Fellowship Academy has close links with NHS Trusts, providing support for
 clinical academics from PhD through to Clinician Scientist Scheme, including the 6-month pump-
 priming fund for clinicians rolled out in MFT.

 All schools have a mid-term Fellowship Review Committee for all extant Fellows which reviews
 progress at 18-24 months to agree strategies and plan forwards. Frequently this results in
 Fellows being offered extensions in order to advance their research programmes to be in an
 optimal position for applying for follow-on funding or more senior fellowship applications. We
 offer a tenure track position if performance is strong (examples in Section 2.1.2).

 Additional support

 UOA3 researchers (Dumville, Harris, Lovell, Stratford) lead initiatives to support and develop
 our staff. These initiatives were shaped in close and iterative consultation with researchers. In
 response to ‘fragmentation of time’ being flagged as a major barrier to grant development, we
 established and embedded six-monthly two-day residential Grant and Fellowship Retreats for
 30-40 researchers. Retreats offer one-on-one sessions facilitated by up to 10 senior academics
 and professional staff. Feedback from the retreats has been overwhelmingly positive, specifically
 around providing ‘protected time’ and one-on-ones with facilitators. Similar to Grant Retreats;
 residential Fellowship Retreats provide intensive support for pre- and post-doctoral, intermediate
 and senior applicants. Across UOA3 we embedded a robust peer review system to ensure the
 highest quality applications are submitted. Post-award we provide workshops for first-time PIs.

 We work with researchers submitting their first PI grant through intensive one-on-one mentoring
 (e.g. Pedley, NIHR RfPB, £150k; Jeyasingham, ESRC New Investigator Grant, £148k;
 Renwick, MRC, £148k). Staff undertaking their first PI role are supported by a senior academic
 in a Co-PI role (e.g. Finegan, Williams, Friends of Rosie, £67k). We also include costs for
 intensive grant mentoring from senior academics into grant applications with researchers who
 are submitting their first grant ensuring protected resource to support development (e.g. Price O,
 NIHR HTA, £520k).

 UOA3 staff (Luker, Neill, Stratford, Dumville) provide regular workshops focussing on ‘abstract
 writing’; ‘what a high quality paper looks like’ (~300 staff attended 2016-2020), and ‘enhancing
 research reach and impact’ (Section 1.6.1). In response to ECR feedback, Milman, Dumville,
 Lovell run a one-day ‘building your research career workshops’ for ECRs.

 Fellowship success

 In UOA3, we have identified and mentored ECRs to successful fellowships. For example, during
 this REF period (those in bold are REF eligible, not bolded indicates those who have moved to
 other institutions / returned to the NHS): Cooke, Jones, Hancock, Krishnamoorthy, Richens,
 Rogers, Wilberforce, Price O, Kemp completed NIHR Doctoral Research Fellowships/NIHR
 Clinical Doctoral Research Fellowships; and Dwyer, Griffiths, Lamph, Lees, Mitchell, Jones,
 Watson, Faulkner were awarded NIHR doctoral Fellowships. Searle (now in UOA1) and
 Pendharker secured CRUK/MCRC/AstraZeneca Clinical PhD Training Fellowships. NIHR post-
 doctoral/Clinical Academic Training Lectureship/Clinical Scientist Fellowships that were
 successfully completed include: Aggarwal, Burden, Brocklehurst. Awarded NIHR Post-doctoral
 Fellowships/Clinical Academic Training Lectureships include: Hawley-Hague, Hartley, Gibbons
 and Rogers. Other NIHR fellowships include: Ravi (NIHR In Practice Fellowship), Farquhar
 (NIHR Career Development Fellowship), Hyde (NIHR Translational Research Fellow), Britteon,
 Foley, Riley, Liu (NIHR Research Methods Fellowship and Internship), Jung-Yin (NIHR in
 Practice Fellow), and two Royal Society Newton International Fellowships (Chickale, Islam).

Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 Doctoral fellowships funded from charities include: CRUK (Tessyman), Stroke Association
 (Plant), Alzheimer’s Society (Ferguson-Coleman), PRUK (Magola, Greenwood), James Tudor
 Foundation (Lui). Examples of charity funded post-doctoral fellowships include: CRUK (Smith,
 Tessyman, Warrington), Breast Cancer Now (Khan), BHF (Camacho-Munoz), Wellcome (Sanz,
 Jones), Marie Curie (DeClerck), GCRF Fellow (Mdoe), Daphne Jackson Fellow (Sarginson),
 Dunhill (Kindle), Leverhulme (Halsall), UKRI/Rutherford Fund Skills Development (Hassan,
 Lindner), and Deafness Support Network (Littlejohn).


 2.1.4. Support for exchanges between academia and business, industry, public, and
        third sector bodies

 We stimulate and facilitate exchanges between academia and business, industry, public and
 third sector bodies, for example, through the secondment of research staff. UoM promotes
 industrial-entrepreneur-in-residence-like projects; for example, Will Goundry from AstraZeneca
 was hosted by NoWCADD in 2019. Staff are actively supported to participate in translational
 research and to collaborate with industry; not only via standard iCASE awards, but also via
 BBSRC Impact Acceleration Awards, the MRC CiC and Proximity to Discovery Industry
 Engagement Funds, and the Wellcome Access to Expertise (A2E) and Projects for Translation
 (P4T) schemes. Successful internal applications to these schemes include Aojula, Freeman,
 Finegan, and Butterworth. In addition, the NIHR-i4i scheme supported linking Stanmore to
 MIRA Rehab Ltd.

 The Faculty and University Business Engagement and Knowledge Exchange teams work with
 partner organisations including HInM, the BRC, and the UoM Innovation Factory to understand
 and appreciate the external industrial landscape and proactively link academics with potential
 industrial partners. UoM has strategic partnerships with, among others, AstraZeneca, GSK,
 ThermoFisher, Smith & Nephew, and Unilever, and members of UOA3 have benefitted (e.g.
 UoM/AZ funding for NoWCADD). In addition to their strategic role, the Business Engagement
 and Knowledge Exchange teams take responsibility for contracts and pricing negotiations and
 provide supporting activities from consultancy, student and staff exchange through to larger
 contracts and strategic partnerships.


 2.1.5. Health and safety

 We are committed to the Health and Safety of our staff, and as well as standard inductions
 provide health and safety training in all laboratory areas. For UOA3 fieldwork staff we provide
 Suzy Lamplugh Trust training and have robust protocols for fieldwork using either 24/7 Lone
 Worker Technology (Skyguard) or mobile phone-based protocols.


 2.2. Category C staff

 Our Category C staff add additional vibrancy to UOA3’s NHS multidisciplinary research and
 leadership activities. All hold MAHSC Chairs, and include: Duncombe (Pharmacy); Lenney
 (Nursing); described in Section 1.6.2. Dentistry has three category C members of staff (Ashley,
 Barclay, Pemberton). All hold clinical posts locally and are nationally networked and provide an
 important link to frontline services, informing decisions around the research we undertake,
 supporting its operationalisation, and facilitating dissemination and implementation.


 2.3. Research students

 UOA3 recognise the importance of research students to the future of our disciplines, and
 building research capacity to contribute to the future research success of the UK by providing

                                                                                            Page 20
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 the highest quality research training. Our culture ensures that students are fully integrated into
 the research culture and provides an environment which actively supports progression of our
 undergraduate students to Masters and PhD level, post-doctoral positions, independent
 fellowships, and ultimately academic/clinical positions. We provide high quality research training,
 consistent with successful capacity building and maintenance of our researcher sustainability
 strategy.

 UOA3 currently has a diverse collection of MSc, MRes, MPhil students, and 261 current doctoral
 students. Of these 203 are full-time / 58 part-time; 51% female / 49% male; ethnicity: White 122
 (47%), Arabic 81 (31%), Chinese 17 (6.5%), other 41 (15.5 %). Our doctoral students come from
 39 countries with 105 (40%) UK.

 During the REF period, 307 PhDs were awarded in UOA3, compared to 221 in REF2014, with
 home (54%): international (34%) and EU (10%). In REF2014, the number of completed doctoral
 students by FTE was 1.96 which has increased to 2.45 per FTE. Since 2014, UOA3 has held: 67
 UKRI studentships (26 from MRC); 15 CASE awards; 16 NIHR doctoral fellowships (pre- and
 post-doctoral NIHR fellowships are reported in Section 2.1.4). PhD students are encouraged to
 publish; of competed UOA3 PhDs in the period, 78% had published at least one paper from their
 theses (by 25/01/21).


 2.3.1. Research student recruitment

 We recruit PhD students from the UK and internationally including clinical and non-clinical.
 MAHSC Trusts are committed to research capacity building and release staff for part time PhD
 study. We have developed flexible approaches, e.g. the development of online research
 methods courses and online supervision and progress monitoring techniques. The EPSRC
 funded North-West Nanoscience Doctoral Training Centre (NowNano) was run by Tirelli until
 2014, and was renewed as the Graphene NowNano DTC (2015 to date, funded by EPSRC and
 industry) with both Kostarelos and Bussy sitting on the management board. During the REF
 period, 20 students (with UOA3 supervisors) have graduated or have been recruited into this
 Centre. Tirelli was Deputy Director (2014-2016), then Director (2016-2017) of the EPSRC/MRC
 CDT in Regenerative Medicine (EP/L014904, £4.4m; now led by Kimber, UOA1). Eight students
 with UOA3 supervisors have come through this program.

 UOA3 developed MRes and MSc provision in health and social care, community pharmacy
 public health services, advanced audiology, and oral implantology. Our Masters programmes
 operate under an ‘alliance’ structure to support interdisciplinary training. Our MClinRes and
 MRes programmes for nurses, midwives and AHPs had 46 NIHR funded places 2014-2017,
 when the scheme ceased. Pharmacy and Dentistry attract large numbers of overseas students
 to their postgraduate programmes. UoM is the only UK Dental School offering a 4-year Clinical
 PhD, allowing clinical development alongside research.

 International students

 UOA3 are committed to supporting international collaborations and study opportunities. PGR
 students in Nursing and Pharmacy practice are able to undertake their PhD as distance learning,
 enabling home and international students with caring or other responsibilities to study without
 compromising their family life. Pharmacy and Dentistry have collaborations with overseas
 universities enabling exchange visits and providing a rich source of PhD students. These include
 the Universities of Indonesia, Boston, Sao Paulo, Wuhan, Hong Kong, the Nippon Dental
 University (Japan), the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Al-Zattoonah
 University of Jordan. In Nursing, close links have been established with Lugina Africa Midwives
 Research Network, supporting midwives from a range of African countries to undertake PhDs.
 As part of our social responsibility programme we have provided fee and living expense support
 to talented students from low- and middle-income countries.


                                                                                            Page 21
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 2.3.2. Monitoring and support mechanisms for postgraduate students

 FBMH has a Doctoral Academy (DA; REF5a, Section 3.3) to support postgraduate research
 from pre-admission to post-viva. The academic requirements of PGR students are supported by
 an Associate Dean for the Faculty and two PGR Directors. Each division has a senior tutor who
 support admissions, training requirements and examinations of all PGR students.

 Primary PhD supervision is provided by experienced supervisors in the cognate area of study.
 PhD progress is monitored and supported through eProg, our online system which maps
 students’ progress, flags key assessment milestones and allows continual supervisory feedback.
 Students are integrated into the research culture of the divisions and schools and encouraged to
 attend regular seminars. Each School has postgraduate prizes, as well as PGR student of the
 year awards at divisional, school, faculty and university level. There are funds and bequests
 available supporting travel, research expenses, and hardship (when required).

 All PGR students attend the induction week at the beginning of their programme. Students can
 access a range of training sessions and courses (discipline-specific and generic), organised
 between CARD and the DA. All UOA3 PGR students engage in research and cultural
 environments. Student showcases run annually allowing students to gain experience of oral and
 poster presentations. The DA dedicates funds for conferences for all PGRs. Students are
 mentored to join appropriate learned societies in order to help secure support for meeting
 attendance, which is then supplemented by the UoM. The DA supports student well-being with a
 dedicated student experience officer and an academic lead for student experience. A dedicated
 team supports students with disabilities.


 2.4. Equality, diversity, and inclusivity

 UOA3 aligns with UoM’s commitment to the principles of Equality, Diversity, and Inclusivity (EDI)
 strategy (REF5a, Section 3.4). The FBMH EDI committee, chaired by the Associate Dean for
 Social Responsibility, meets quarterly, including wide-ranging representation. Our commitment
 to EDI is demonstrated by our active engagement in the career advancement of female and
 BAME academics, and through our participation in Athena SWAN and Project JUNO.

 UOA3 has taken an intersectional focus to address the additional barriers faced by BAME
 women staff and students. UoM currently holds six Silver and eight Bronze Athena SWAN
 awards. Both the School of Health Sciences and the School of Medical Sciences achieved
 Athena SWAN Silver status (2018). Our commitment to the career advancement of BAME staff
 is evidenced through our Race Equality Charter Mark Bronze. We are a Disability Confident
 employer and a Stonewall top-100 employer for LGBTQ inclusion.

 UoM has made substantial progress delivering the equality agenda, evidenced by women now
 accounting for 32% of senior academics and 27% of professoriate, 56% of Professional Services
 staff in senior grades, 44% of Heads of School, 50% of Faculty Leadership Teams, and 36% of
 Senior Leadership Teams. We also secured increased numbers of women students progressing
 onto postgraduate programmes.

 Coaching provision for FBMH staff

 Our staff are actively engaged with the coaching provision available via Staff Learning and
 Development. An evaluation demonstrated that 100% of participants would recommend the
 coaching to colleagues.




                                                                                           Page 22
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 BAME advocacy and working group

 FBMH launched the pilot flagship Inclusive Advocacy Programme, designed to ensure high-
 performing researchers from under-represented groups are supported which aims to increase
 diversity in leadership positions and promote inclusivity within academic culture.

 Support for women

 Women in FBMH provides a support network, organising events and courses promoting EDI,
 e.g. confidence and personal impact workshops and International Women’s Day events. Athena
 SWAN teams have held a number of events to promote flexible working and wellbeing.

 Support for carers

 Caring commitments can be a barrier preventing career development activities. A carer’s fund
 provides PGRs with caring responsibilities additional financial support (up to £300) to attend
 conferences and workshops.


 2.4.1. Examples of equality, diversity, and inclusivity in UOA3

 We have invested in the development of a research workforce that reflects EDI. UOA3 takes an
 intersectional inequalities approach whilst highlighting people with specific protected
 characteristics. Examples include:

 •   Inclusive workforce: in UOA3, women head all of the divisions. Young and Edge have
     University-wide academic lead roles addressing disability equality and race equality. Our
     workforce is enriched by employment of, or consultancy with, people with specific protected
     characteristics including deaf young people, people with severe mental health disorders and
     both carers of, and people living with, dementia. In the Social Research with Deaf People
     group (SORD), all staff and students are fluent in one signed and one written language
     (whether they are hearing or Deaf). SORD’s research practice and outputs in language(s)
     and culture(s) reflect the diversity of Deaf community nationally / internationally. The group
     includes the first Deaf sign language user to win NIHR doctoral and postdoctoral fellowships
     (Rogers) and the first Deaf signer to secure an Alzheimer’s Society doctoral scholarship
     (Ferguson-Coleman).
 •   Inclusive research practices: UOA3 facilitates joint working and co-authorship between
     lead researchers and service user and carer team members. For example, two papers led by
     service user and carer co-applicants: Cree/Bee BMC Psychiatry
     2015,DOI:10.1111/jpm.12275; Grundy/Lovell J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs
     2016,DOI:10.1111/jpm.12378.
 •   We take a structural approach to understanding inequalities in specific communities, for
     example unequal access in service delivery including Afro-Caribbean people with severe
     mental health (Edge), remote delivery of psychological interventions for people with common
     mental health problems (Bee), Deaf signers’ IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological
     Therapies) outcomes (Young, Rogers). Other research highlighting people with specific
     protected characteristics include older adults with sensory issues (Todd, Plack, Munro),
     carers and people with dementia (Keady), and young carers of parents with severe mental
     health problems (Bee).

 Our REF2021 Code of Practice complies with equality and diversity legislation and provides a
 transparent explanation of our approach for our REF2021 submission.




                                                                                           Page 23
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 2.5. Staff wellbeing

 In 2016, UoM set out a Wellbeing Strategy with a mission “to promote and enhance wellbeing for
 all staff through the development of a proactive and enabling culture” (REF5a, Section 3.3.2).
 This involves responsibility at university, managerial, and individual levels. Actions included the
 launch of the Manchester Ways to Wellbeing Campaign, with six ways identified: Connect; Be
 Active; Take Notice; Learn and Discover; Give; and Be Healthy, promoted via a ‘wellbeing
 champion’s network’ with 12 champions within FBMH. Guidance on engaging with wellbeing is
 given to all staff through lectures and a host of online materials. UoM’s Counselling and Mental
 Health Service provides a range of well-being workshops, and is partnered with the GM Health
 and Social Care Partnership to offer an integrated approach to supporting students. UoM
 provides dedicated space (‘Wellbeing Rooms’) for wellbeing activities. UoM’s Dignity at Work
 policy for staff and students implements our commitment to zero tolerance of discrimination,
 harassment or bullying, supported by our specialist team and reporting channels.

 Further activities that support implementation of the Wellbeing Strategy for UOA3 staff include:

 •   FBMH policy to avoid sending emails outside 0700-1900 on workdays.
 •   The formation of small staff groups and timetabling of virtual lunch/coffee meetings in
     divisions during the pandemic with a team leader responsible for the wellbeing of staff.




                                                                                            Page 24
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities

 3.1. Research income

 Our total research income in REF2021 is £99.7m including REF4c funding (or £94.9m without
 REF4c funding) compared with £42.7m in REF2014. To account for differences in submitted
 staff FTE and the differing length of each REF period, we summarise this as annual research
 income per submitted and eligible staff FTE. In REF2014 we submitted 90% of eligible staff and
 the mean annual income per submitted staff FTE was £75,834. The income per eligible staff
 FTE was £67,558. The REF2021 mean annual research income per submitted/eligible staff is
 £113,427 (an increase of 68%).




 Figure 5. Research income for key HESA categories in REF2014 and REF2021


 Figure 5 shows a large funding increase from UK central government and related sources,
 largely due to successes with substantial NIHR grants including infrastructure funding. We have
 maintained income from research councils and, after focused efforts to diversify funding, we
 have increased our funding from UK-based charities. Our efforts to increase industry and EU
 funding are also evidenced with large relative increases in income from these sources; e.g. UK
 industry and related funding increased from £4m to £10.5m. There has also been a general
 increase in EU government-based funding from £1.8m to £7.2m.


 3.1.1. NIHR funding

 UOA3 have been successful in NIHR grants awarded to UoM and NHS Trusts, with 130 awards
 (80 awards led by UOA3) during the REF period (Table 1). This equates to a total award value of
 £161m with award value to UoM of £64m of which £29m is to UOA3.




                                                                                         Page 25

 3.1.2. Industry funding

 UOA3 researchers led on 145 individual industrial grant awards (total: £17.8m). Taking account
 of credit share given to researchers in UOA3, as PIs and Co-Is, total income to UOA3 from all
 industrial grants was £20.6m. An example of substantive income to staff acting as Co-Is in
 grants led by other UOAs is Nicolaou (£193k) leading the lipidomic discovery theme on the
 £3.9m Boots-funded dermatology framework grant (Griffiths, UOA1).

 Building on our industrial collaborations, UOA3 staff, acting as PIs, have secured £6.9m funding
 from Innovate UK. These include Neill and Harte (£2.2m; Autifony Healthcare, overcoming
 cognitive defects in animal models of neurological diseases) and McBain and Cullum (£843k;
 two projects: Archbiocides; wound antibiotic development). Examples are shown in Table 2.

 3.2. Infrastructure and facilities that support UOA3 research

 UoM operates an investment strategy that enables excellence through facilitating
 interdisciplinary research (REF5a, Section 2iii). It is within this context that the investment in
 buildings and facilities supports our environment and UOA3 researchers.




                                                                                                Page 29
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 3.2.1. Research Services Team

 UoM’s Research Services Team is responsible for leading an integrated and effective research
 service that maximises our ability to attract researchers and research income, undertake high-
 quality research, and exploit research outcomes. The team provides cross-faculty support for
 research, including a specialist EU office, compliance and risk management, research
 governance and data protection.


 3.2.2. Research and Business Engagement Team

 FBMH Research and Business Engagement Team provide advice and guidance on funding
 opportunities, costing and submitting applications.


 3.2.3. Strategic Funding Team

 FBMH’s Strategic Funding Team supports and coordinates large strategic grant proposals;
 facilitates themed workshops that help collaborations prosper; performs strategic analysis of
 outputs and impact from funded research to inform strategy.


 3.2.4. University Library

 UoM’s Library has the most extensive digital collections in the UK and enables UOA3
 researchers seamless access to extensive discipline-specific collections. The library supports
 the researcher from initial research data management planning to open access compliance.


 3.2.5. Manchester Clinical Trials Unit

 The Manchester Clinical Trials Unit (MCTU) transferred from the Christie Hospital to UoM to
 maximise our ability to conduct high-quality research. MCTU has 55 staff, is registered by the
 UK Clinical Research Collaboration, and receives funding from NIHR, CRUK, UoM and HInM.


 3.2.6. IT support

 UOA3 researchers and students benefit from centralised IT support covering routine user
 support through to data storage and high-performance computing. The dedicated Research IT
 Team comprising ~50 FTEs provides support for a broad range of activities, including HPC
 platforms, a dedicated Research VM Service, cloud-based resources, and research software
 engineers. UoM provides a secure centralised data storage system.

 Much of our computational work uses the Computational Shared Facility (CSF). The CSF is
 integrated with the Research Data Storage platform providing ~8PB of resilient storage. A
 working group (Bryce, board member), meets regularly with Research IT staff to discuss
 computing and storage needs, ensuring user requirements are fed into the central team.


 3.2.7. Research facilities

 The vision for the research infrastructure in UoM is to provide state-of-the-art research facilities
 operated by skilled staff, delivering key technologies and generating a skills repository, essential




                                                                                              Page 30
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 to maintain research competitiveness (REF5a, Section 4.2). These facilities engage with the
 research community within FBMH, other UoM faculties, and with partner healthcare Trusts.

 FBMH hosts eight Core Research Facilities: Bioimaging, Biological Mass Spectrometry (BMS),
 Biomolecular Analysis, Electron Microscopy, Flow Cytometry, Genomic Technologies, Genome
 Editing and Histology. UOA3 researchers have complementary bespoke facilities where
 expertise can be called upon from the Core Facilities including: Nicolaou for lipidomic BMS;
 Rostami, Barber, Galetin for proteomic BMS; and Williams for in vivo PET and MR imaging.
 Facilities embedded within UOA3 include:

 •   Audiology has nine bespoke double-walled soundproof booths, including equipment for
     evoked potential, behavioural, and audiometric testing. There are vestibular, hearing aid, and
     dry bench laboratories. Clinical research is also conducted at NHS sites.
 •   Optometry has five ophthalmic consulting rooms exclusively for clinical research, larger
     clinical suites with a wide range of high-end research-orientated examination
     instrumentation, and laboratories set-up for the conduct of psychophysics, physiological
     optics, and other research with human subjects. Research is also conducted within
     designed clinical spaces shared with undergraduate training.
 •   The NoWCADD consortium has a suite of equipment, including the Asia flow reactor, the
     LV1 high pressure microfluidizer, and the CF2000 centrifugal field flow fractionation,
     dedicated to the preparation and characterisation of advanced complex medicines,
     particularly particulate nanomedicines.

 A key FBMH resource is the Biological Services Facility (BSF) providing a range of model
 organisms. UOA3 researchers take advantage of the rodent and zebrafish facilities with 56 of
 our 314 submitted outputs involving the use of the BSF. The BSF has 9000m2 of usable space, a
 turnover of £2.5m, and 42 FTE staff, making it one of the largest in Europe. There has been
 £1.4m investment since 2014, including a new, state-of-the-art germ-free facility. To ensure
 liaison between the academic community and staff involved with animal care, the BSF has a
 Management Advisory Group (including Stratford).

 Investment and growth in facilities

 Core research facilities have grown substantially (REF5a, Section 4.2). Over £28m has been
 invested by UoM in the equipment base in FMBH, with associated staff increasing from 33
 (2014) to 49 (2020). The increased size and capacity are reflected in turnover, increasing from
 <£2m (2014) to ~£3.5m (2020). We operate a transparent and equitable charging policy,
 facilitated by an online system, allowing charges to be levied uniformly with discounts applied to
 support postgraduate training. Dentistry has benefitted from a £50m capital programme
 renovating the Coupland 3 building, adjacent to the University Dental Hospital and the Colgate
 Palmolive Dental Health Unit 100 metres away in Manchester Science Park. Renovations
 include: a bespoke Dental Biomaterials laboratory providing key facilities for researchers at the
 clinical/basic science interface (Silikas, Watt, Chen); laboratory space for PGR students; and a
 33-desk postgraduate computer suite.




                                                                                            Page 31

     universities; and as a reviewer for the Nobel
     Prize in Physiology or Medicine.



 Forty-two UOA3 staff have a recognised role within the NHS, and 35 have an honorary contract
 with an NHS Trust. Five staff hold clinical roles including medics, nurses, optometrists, dentists,
 and allied health professionals. One staff member chairs a clinical commissioning group.

 Staff have key roles in Clinical Guidelines, guidance and monitoring including: Public Health
 England Monitoring Report (Pretty); International Guidance on resin composites (Silikas); NICE
 Guideline NG98 (Munro); ISO 532-3 Acoustics Methods for calculating loudness
 (Schlittenlacher); NHS England guidelines for translation and interpreting in Primary Care
 (Young); Royal College of Psychiatrists guidelines for commissioning mental health services for
 deaf people (Young); Expert Adviser for NICE Centre for Guidelines, DH/NIHR Translational
 Research Working Group for the 'Framework for Mental Health Research' (Lovell); Clinical
 Consensus Panel on the use of lissamine green in clinical practice (Maldonado-Codina); Joint
 report with National Data Guardian based on citizen juries (Tully).


 4.3.2. Patents

 UOA3 staff have produced 15 patents in the REF period and include:

 •     Rostami-Hodjegan, Barber, Achour, Rothman (2018). Methods for quantifying protein
       abundance in tissues via cell free ribonucleic acids in blood. US Patent 62648984.
 •     Murray, Carden (2016). Method and apparatus for measuring a property of an eye of a
       subject. US patent no 9526413.

 4.3.3. Contribution to community engagement

 UOA3’s research is directed towards the health, social care and mental health of our local and
 wider communities). We engage with our public both in the form of specialist patient groups
 (Section 1.6.3), and public engagement activities. Examples include:

 •   ManCAD (led by Munro) published ‘100 Years of Audiology and Deaf Education at UoM’ and
     curated an exhibition of audiology artefacts, and organised evening talks, at the Manchester
     Central Library (2019).
 •   The Prevention of Falls Network for Dissemination (ProFouND), a consortium of 11 EU
     countries led by Todd, delivered annual campaigns to raise awareness of falls prevention.
     This was supported by a comprehensive media and featured an EU wide flash mob involving
     500 people from nine EU countries to increase uptake of local strength and balance classes.
 •   Edge organised free public mental health conferences with key stakeholders attracting
     >2,000 delegates, and received the Distinguished Award for Services to Community Mental
     Health by the Black Health Agency and African and Caribbean Mental Services (2017).
 •   Bee with 42nd Street (a GM mental health charity for young people) co-produced ‘HIDDEN’,
     an immersive theatre show, to raise public awareness of young carers. Partnership with
     Queen's University enabled performances of HIDDEN to be supplemented with the
     LiveShout! App, reaching 350,000 people. HIDDEN was shortlisted for best fringe production
     at the 2017 Northern Soul Awards.
 •   Co-ordinated by Lovell, NIHR CLAHRC GM collaborated with over 20 NHS Mental Health
     Trusts and organisations to hold a week-long festival raising awareness of physical and
     mental illness. Over 900 people attended various creative arts, sports events, public lectures
     and a theatre performance. The event was awarded the 2015 GM Clinical Research Award
     for public engagement.
 •   Neill has developed strategies, via open public meetings, to reschedule some psychedelic
     drugs from class I to class II.
 •   To widen participation, researchers led by Munro designed a bespoke transit van with a
     soundproof booth that travels into local communities to increase uptake of hearing tests,
     especially in vulnerable groups
 •   Bee and Lovell’s Indonesia/UK collaboration ran a 6-day mental health public engagement
     with 18 events with over 700 participants in Indonesia (2018).
 •   Freeman, Humphreys, Ledder, McBain, Tirella have made a sustained contribution to the
     education of the public, schools and UoM students on AntiMicrobial Resistance (AMR),
     including invited public engagement events e.g. Café Scientifique, annual World Antibiotic
     Awareness Week events, 1500 secondary school pupils taught by UoM students and signed
     as antibiotic guardians, 200 primary school children taught about AMR through
     handwashing, annual interactive stalls at UoM British Science Week, Science Spectacular
     and Community festivals (footfall >1000/event).
