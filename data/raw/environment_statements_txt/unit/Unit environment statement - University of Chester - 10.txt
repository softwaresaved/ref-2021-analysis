 Unit of Assessment: B10 Mathematical Sciences

 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy

1.1 Context
Research in Mathematical Sciences is undertaken by the Mathematics Research Group, led by
FORD, formed from staff from the Department of Mathematical & Physical Sciences and other
associated staff from the Faculty of Science and Engineering at the University of Chester. Research
in the Faculty is based at Thornton Science Park, the former Shell Research facility, a unique location
serving as a platform for the interaction of academia (students of Mathematics and academic staff)
with industry and commerce. The Science Park (part of the Cheshire Science Corridor) hosts around
40 companies working in the strategic areas of Energy, Automotive, Environment, and Advanced
Manufacturing, providing project and employment opportunities for students and collaborations in
research. In 2021 there are plans to relocate some of the department’s activities to the Exton Park
site in close proximity to researchers in medical science and biosciences. This will facilitate even
closer research interactions in future with those areas.

The University of Chester Corporate Plan makes an explicit commitment to supporting an expanding
and innovative University research environment that ensures high quality research and innovative
practices that help influence the development and improvement of society. The University Research
Strategy has identified Mathematics research as one of the University’s areas of strength and has
committed to support and invest in the work of the Group. The Group’s activities link to all four of the
University’s core themes for research, with particular focus on applications to Health and Wellbeing
and Local Economy. The future strategy of the Mathematical Sciences Unit of Assessment (UoA) is
fully aligned with the University’s research and impact plans for the next five years. The performance
of the Unit during this REF period is strong, meeting objectives set in REF2014:

   •   To continue to focus on numerical and analytical solution of functional differential equations;
   •   To extend links with applications areas through continued collaboration (inter alia) with Freed
       and Bocharov;
   •   To continue to co-operate with long-term collaborative partners in Lisbon, Vila Real,
       Braunschweig, Stockholm and to develop new partnerships;
   •   To develop new collaborations through the Science and Engineering Faculty and Thornton
       Science Park;
   •   To extend capability through new staff appointments;
   •   To develop expertise in rheology, materials modelling and robotics.

1.2 Structure
Leadership of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Department, where the UoA is set, has been
provided by the Head of Department Jason Roberts, advised by the Faculty and University
Committees. Leadership of the Research Group is provided by Prof Neville Ford (Director of the
Mathematical Sciences Research Group and (currently) Pro-Vice Chancellor (Research and
Innovation)). There is a strong synergy between teaching and research: students benefit from a
curriculum that is enhanced by links to our research and this strengthens progression to
postgraduate study and research careers.

In REF2021, we are submitting 7 staff (headcount) to UoA 10, the same number as were submitted
in REF2014. One person submitted in 2014 has moved to another UoA in REF2021, and two have
retired. We have significantly increased the number of women staff through 3 new appointments
since REF2014 and we are submitting an additional existing member of staff who has returned to
research from other academic responsibilities during this REF period.




                                                                                                Page 1
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
Specifically, and aligned with our strategy, we have made the following important additions to our
staff base:

Antonopoulou (appointed as Senior Lecturer, promoted to Associate Professor in 2019) from the
University of Crete. She had created in Greece, and then developed in UK, an extended network of
international collaborations with researchers from Greece (Crete), Canada (Toronto), USA (Purdue,
Michigan), Germany (Augsburg, Tuebingen, Bielefeld), France (Paris) and Japan (Tokyo, Waseda),
in Stochastic PDEs and Stochastic Analysis (mathematical areas where UK has a leading role in the
global research landscape). Since her arrival at the University of Chester, she has received a
prestigious Prize from the Academy of Athens, Greece for her work in Analysis (December 2016),
and she was externally funded by a Conferences - Scheme 1, LMS Grant (Research Grants of
London Mathematical Society) in 2019, for the organisation of the international Workshop held at the
University of Chester entitled 'Recent Trends in Stochastic Analysis and Partial Differential
Equations', with the participation of world-leading mathematicians in the area from Bath, Edinburgh,
Imperial College London, Toronto, Purdue, Bordeaux, Crete and Augsburg. Antonopoulou has also
established effective collaborations with Kavallaris, Roberts and Yan within the Chester group.

Karakatsani (appointed as Lecturer, promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2019) from Strathclyde
University. Karakatsani organised an LMS-sponsored workshop in 2015 entitled: ‘A posteriori error
control and mesh adaptivity for time dependent and nonlinear problems’. Karakatsani and
Antonopoulou were amongst the speakers. Karakatsani organised a minisymposium at MAFELAP
Conference, (Brunel, June 2016) on ‘Adaptive methods and singular solutions of nonlinear problems’
and was invited to participate in the Hausdorff Trimester Program ‘Multiscale Problems: Algorithms,
Numerical Analysis and Computation’ organised by specialists in the field of Applied and
Computational Mathematics (Bonn, Germany, April 2017). Karakatsani also collaborated with
Barrenechea from Strathclyde, and Burman from UCL in February 2015.

Taylor (appointed in 2020, formerly PhD student within the group) strengthens our commitment to
work on Algebra, Number Theory and applications to Coding. Her primary interests are group rings
and their applications to coding theory. She has established a stronger connection between group
rings and self-dual codes, proving that a group ring element corresponds to a self-dual code if and
only if it is a unitary unit. She continues to research new techniques for constructing self-dual codes.

For many years the main research focus of the Mathematics Research Group was the analytical and
numerical analysis of deterministic and stochastic functional differential equations. This submission
represents growth and broadening of our research into several inter-related and overlapping
research themes, in line with the plans presented in REF2014. The submission consists of all 7
members of the Mathematics academic staff of the Department on the census date: 1 Professor; 4
Associate Professors; 2 Senior Lecturers. The Group has been further augmented through the recent
appointment of Taylor.

In addition to the members of the Group submitted to Mathematical Sciences in REF2021
(Antonopoulou, Ford, Gildea, Karakatsani, Kavallaris, Roberts, Yan), reference will also be made to
the work of the late CTH Baker (former member of the Group), Taylor (recently appointed ECR and
former PhD student within our Group), and Mc Auley & Wilkinson (submitted to other REF2021
Units), who are also members and collaborators with the Group, with interests in modelling in medical
science and biosciences).

The research of the Group is organised within the following overlapping themes:

   •   Algebra, Number Theory and applications of Group Algebras to Coding Theory: Gildea,
       Taylor.
   •   Analysis, Applied Analysis and Numerical Analysis: Ford, Antonopoulou, Roberts, Kavallaris,
       Karakatsani, Yan, (Baker).
   •   Mathematical Modelling: Ford, Antonopoulou, Roberts, Kavallaris, (Baker, Mc Auley,
       Wilkinson).
   •   Stochastic Analysis: Antonopoulou, Yan, Kavallaris, (Baker).

                                                                                                Page 2

1.3 Research and Impact Strategy
In Mathematical Sciences, our strategy is to pursue world class and internationally excellent research
that leads to outcomes that will have impact on other researchers and disciplines and (where
possible) have wider economic and societal benefits. We seek to achieve this through the
appointment of excellent researchers to our academic staff, who are encouraged to collaborate with
others (both within academia and beyond) and to undertake leading-edge research in Chester. Our
strategy today has developed directly from the vision we gave in REF2014 and it articulates
especially with the University strategy core themes through our work on modelling in the biomedical
sciences (Health and Wellbeing theme) and our work on applications in materials science and
engineering (Local Economy theme). These are the areas where we anticipate to grow further our
impact plans.

We have continued to work on numerical and analytical solution of functional differential equations
(outputs by Ford, Roberts, Yan, Baker). Aligned with our overall strategy, we have extended our
capability and have developed high quality research expertise in analysis and numerical treatment
of partial differential equations and stochastic PDE problems (outputs by Antonopoulou, Karakatsani,
Kavallaris). We have also developed effective numerical methods for fractional partial differential
equations (outputs by Yan, Ford).

Our modelling activities have built on our previous work with Bocharov and Freed: we have
developed further work in immunology through working with Immunosys and Immundnz, the immune
response company based at Alderley Park in the Cheshire Science Corridor, which led (for example)
to an invited plenary lecture (by Ford) at IWANASP 2015. We have developed interests in research
related to mathematical modelling of ageing (outputs by Roberts, Kavallaris, Mc Auley), DNA
methylation, and cholesterol metabolism. In addition, we have developed expertise in materials
science through working with L.L. Ferras (Minho) and his co-workers on problems in polymer
sciences (outputs by Ford).

We have built further on our collaborations, which have always been a strong feature of the Chester
department: we now have ongoing collaborations with colleagues from Minho, as well as those
existing collaborations with colleagues from a wide range of Universities worldwide and featuring all
members of the research group. Full details are provided in Section 4.

The development of the Science, Engineering and Technology faculty and the Science Park has
provided opportunity for further interdisciplinary co-working with colleagues from Chemical
Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Chemistry (for example, in co-authored
outputs and co-supervised doctoral students with Mc Auley).

Application of the results of research undertaken by the Mathematics Research Group has always
been at the heart of the Group’s activities and has formed the basis for our Impact strategy. The
Group has a strong interest in modelling. Recognising that mathematics research usually has an
indirect, rather than direct impact, there has therefore been a considerable focus on engaging with
scientists from areas which themselves interact directly with users. Some of these interactions take
place with colleagues and companies based on Thornton Science Park and many others (such as
those with Immunosys and Immundnz) with other local and regional organisations. These
interactions and insights have driven the areas of research activity and helped prioritise impactful
research questions for the Group's work as well as expanding the capacity of a small group to
conduct high quality research with impact. Both impact case studies submitted build on the emphasis
on interdisciplinary work, with strong partnerships with applied researchers, and provide evidence
for the success of this strategy.

The fundamental approach of the Mathematics Research Group is to interact early with people who
already understand the application area. The aim is to ensure that the needs of the application area
are translated through this collaboration into clear and achievable mathematical objectives and
research questions. Having formulated the research questions, the strategy is to work on the
mathematical project but keep the lines of communication with users open to test new insights

                                                                                              Page 3
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
against reality. The final stage in the process is to communicate and disseminate results, both in the
mathematical literature and translated into a form that will be useful to the users. A feedback
mechanism is then employed by listening continuously to the users to see how they interpret and
use the results. This feedback mechanism provides one basis for subsequent mathematical
objective-setting.

The effective application of this approach can be evidenced, for example, through the work
undertaken as part of a project with Immundnz and a consultancy project for Barcanet. Our
collaborations with Diethelm (FHWS, formerly at GNS, Braunschweig), Bocharov (INMRAS), and
Ferras (Minho) also link directly to these aims.

Mathematical modelling techniques are used by scientists working on ageing and cancer to predict
problems in DNA strains, predict cell movements in a cancerous environment, and capture possible
cancerous cell behaviour, aligning with our strategic theme of Health and Wellbeing. Alongside this
vital medical impact, mathematical modelling research on the thermal behaviour of perovskite solar
cells is world-leading and provides an important contribution to the green-energy sector, as well as
input into energy-based government policy.

Further impact is anticipated through increased public engagement/outreach and continued focus
on sharing high quality research with other researchers and disciplines via presentations,
conferences and publications, leading to increased citation and adoption of our cutting-edge
mathematical techniques as a substantive base for future applied research. We have embraced
Open Access publication as a core goal for all our outputs since 2014, with the Institutional
Repository (ChesterRep) being a source for all our work, and we are actively working towards
adopting Open Data standards, in line with the University’s strategy. This contributes to ensuring our
research activities meet the highest standards of research integrity and that research results are
reproducible. Where appropriate, research proposals involving human or animal subjects are
considered by the Science and Engineering Faculty Ethics Committee.

1.4 Future Strategic Aims and Goals
In line with the University’s overall Research Strategy, the Mathematical Sciences research group
will continue to develop internationally excellent and world-leading research. Our work will link to the
University’s core themes of Health and Wellbeing and Local Economy, through the areas of
application, and the impact partners we have and continue to establish. We will seek to grow further
work with applications to Sustainability and Environment.

Our strategic research goals are:

In Algebra, Number Theory and applications to Coding:
    • through collaboration with members of the Computer Science Group, to continue with our
       work on crypto systems and secret sharing, and its ongoing impact on the field of Computer
       Science. (Gildea, Taylor)

In Analysis, Applied Analysis and Numerical Analysis:
    • to continue to work on functional differential equations and (especially) fractional differential
       equations including fractional PDEs and to develop high order reliable numerical methods.
       (Ford, Yan)
   •   to interact with the Electrical Engineering Group, on nonlinear control models from Energy
       Systems (nonlinear systems of ODEs where a global stability mathematical analysis is
       essential for the development of the existing applications implemented so far for linear
       models). This work furthers our ongoing impact on the green-energy sector, aligns with the
       University’s Environment and Sustainability strategic core theme, and continues our
       important contribution to energy-based government policy. (Antonopoulou, Kavallaris)
   •   to continue to develop our expertise in Finite Elements (Antonopoulou, Yan, Karakatsani) to
       support joint research with the Electrical Engineering Group in the Faculty.

                                                                                                Page 4
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
   •   to continue to develop our expertise in the mathematical analysis of non-local models
       (involving non-local diffusion) arising in MEMS industry and Evolutional Game Theory
       (Kavallaris).

In Mathematical Modelling:
    • to continue to work on mathematical immunology and modelling of viral spread, drug
       therapies and the ageing process, and to build further links and collaborations with
       colleagues from biology, medicine, health and social sciences, aligning to the Health and
       Wellbeing strand of the Research Strategy. (Ford, Mc Auley)
   •   to develop further our modelling work relating to problems in materials science, control and
       engineering through collaborations with colleagues from the physical and engineering
       sciences. (Ford)

In Stochastic Analysis:
    • to work with the materials science group on Stochastic PDEs arising from phase separation
       of alloys (Antonopoulou, Kavallaris, Yan)

Each of these research themes is led by an oversight group which has responsibility for overseeing
the research plan and managing the effective dissemination, outreach and impact of the work. Our
existing approach to impact, involving early interaction with users of the research, is core to the
approach.

 2. People

2.1 Staffing strategy and staff development
Our staffing strategy focuses on all academic staff in Mathematical Sciences having a core area of
research that links with our research themes, as described above. All existing members of the team
have strong research backgrounds, with a record of internationally excellent and world-leading
research. Where vacancies arise, we aim to recruit excellent researchers whose work is
complementary to our existing team and who will continue to broaden and strengthen our core
themes. We also aim to attract promising ECRs, postdoctoral researchers and Master/PhD students
of high scientific potential.

5 permanent staff submitted to REF2014 are still in post; from the current submission, 5 out of 7
have been promoted during the REF period: 4 are now Associate Professors (Antonopoulou,
Kavallaris, Roberts, Yan), and 1 Senior Lecturer (Karakatsani). Changes during the REF period have
been as a result of retirement and expansion.

As part of their development, PhD students and Research Master students are encouraged, with
appropriate training and support, to contribute to teaching, tutorials and computer laboratory
sessions. This has been a successful strategy in helping their career development and enabling their
transition to academic posts in Chester and elsewhere (see below).

There is a monthly record of research outcomes collected by the Head of Department (HoD) and
reported at Faculty level. This ensures that progress is monitored independently and that resources
can be made available to any activities requiring further support.

The HoD (Roberts) arranges an annual individual Performance and Development Planning (PDP)
meeting where teaching, research, journal/book publications, impact and funding received is
discussed with staff. PDP meetings support feedback and useful interaction on teaching, research,
promotions and funding from the University, Research Councils and charities.

As part of our focus on developing our staff and students, the Mathematical Sciences Research
Group supports research visitors and staff research visits and travels. The Group has hosted
significant collaborators, such as: Akrivis (Ioannina, Greece), B. Jin (UCL), Barrenechea
(Strathclyde), Bloemker (Augsburg, Germany), Cangiani (Nottingham), Chanpin Li (Shanghai,

                                                                                            Page 5
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
China), Corfe (Sheffield), Dedner (Warwick), Dougherty (Scranton, USA), Kamvissis (Crete,
Greece), Karali (Crete, Greece), A. Kaya (Jakarta, Indonesia), Lacey (Heriot Watt), Matzavinos
(Brown, USA), Pani (Mumbai, India), Prohl (Tuebingen, Germany), Salcedo-Sora (Liverpool),
Shardlow (Bath), I.M. Sigal (Toronto, Canada), Suzuki (Osaka, Japan), Tylyshchak (Uzhgorod,
Ukraine), Waterson (Ulster), Winkler (Paderborn, Germany), Xue-Mei Li (Imperial), Yildiz (Toronto,
USA), Yip (Purdue, USA), Zhou (Hong Kong), and Zimmer (Bath).

Research visits of staff for collaboration were supported to various Universities and Research
Institutions of significant and world-leading research activity such as: Ford at Brno, Ghent and
Braunschweig, Kavallaris at Brown, KAUST, Osaka, BRICS, ESGI, Universita di Napoli Federico II,
Paderborn and Bielefeld, Karakatsani at Maryland, Warwick, Hausdorff Research Institute for
Mathematics, Ioannina, Crete, Sussex, Strathclyde and IACM-FORTH, Yan at UCL, Shanghai and
Zhou Zhi, Mc Auley at Ulster, and Antonopoulou at Bielefeld, Augsburg, Heraklion, Athens, York and
IACM-FORTH, Roberts at Ghent.

Early Career Researchers are supported in several ways: Each ECR has a mentor to guide them
during their first few years to ensure that they make sound progress in establishing themselves as
independent researchers. The workload model takes account of the need to prepare new material
for teaching (for example) so that research time is not prejudiced. As a consequence, ECRs normally
teach on fewer courses than more experienced colleagues. The Department ensures an allocation
of research funding to support ECR travel and visitors to aid developing collaborations.

2.2 Training and supervision of PGR students
During the current REF period, the Mathematical Sciences Group admitted 4 PT MPhil/PhD, 5 FT
MPhil/PhD and 2 MRes students. The PGR programme is run through the participation of all staff in
teaching and skill development as well as supervision of dissertations.

Significant expertise is transferred through lectures, tutorials and laboratories by the highly
experienced members of staff, in all areas of the UoA’s research; we also aim to develop students’
employability skills useful for careers in academia and industry. Our Research Seminar, and the
weekly PGR Seminar, are addressed to PhD students. We regularly provide year-long weekly
seminar series (organised by Yan and Antonopoulou): for example, on the theme “Numerical
Methods for Stochastic PDEs”, during 2015-16, and “Fractional Brownian Stochastic Processes”,
during 2018-19. Further departmental seminars have been provided on “Generation of Interfaces for
the Stochastic Allen-Cahn equation”, “Existence and Regularity for the Stochastic Cahn-
Hilliard/Allen-Cahn Equation”, “A Posteriori Error Analysis of Time-Dependent Problems” and “Finite-
Time Blow-Up of Parabolic Stochastic PDEs.” PGR students who undertake teaching duties are
supported to attend ‘New To Teaching’ workshops run by the mathematics community nationally as
well as specific training organised in Chester. PGR students nearing completion of studies have also
been supported to attend early career events run by professional bodies.

Members of permanent academic staff in the UoA normally have at least one PhD student and
several master-level students under their supervision. PGR supervision is provided through
supervisory teams of at least two supervisors to ensure that students are supported in their research
by advice from more than one viewpoint, and also to ensure continuity of supervision in the event of
staff changes or absence. PGR student representatives participate in Staff/Student Committee
meetings where matters relating to supervision, facilities and support can be discussed.

During the current REF period, the University has invested to provide three fully funded PhD
Scholarships in Mathematics, in addition to those funded from other sources. Where students aspire
to a career in academia, fixed-term hourly contracts for lectures, tutorials and laboratory sessions
are offered and these have helped PGR students move into academic employment on completion
of their studies (Taylor, Malique, Zagkos, Pal and Rowntree). Malique is now an Assistant Professor
at Hfar Al Batin, Zagkos is a Research Associate in the Department of Life Sciences, Brunel, Pal is
a lecturer at United Arab Emirates University, Khan is attending PGCE training, Taylor is a lecturer
at Chester and Rowntree is a Research Associate at the School of Medical Sciences at Manchester.
Widening access to PhD study is enhanced by the part-time route, which has proved attractive to

                                                                                             Page 6
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
returners to study, mature students (including those with caring and family responsibilities) and to
those who wish to work part time to support their study as well as those with certain disabilities (in
the REF period, 46% of part-time PGR students were female, and 42% were known to be disabled).
Students following this route have been extremely successful in completing their studies and gaining
employment in Universities and research positions elsewhere and this alternative route has also
been successful in expanding the diversity of our PGR population.

Collaboration with UTAD
Through a memorandum of co-operation with UTAD in Vila Real, Portugal, which is not currently
able to award its own PhD degrees in Mathematics, and supported by the Erasmus exchange
programme, students may be co-supervised by recognised and trained colleagues from UTAD
alongside experienced Chester supervisors on PhD programmes leading to examination and award
of a Chester PhD qualification. This has led to further co-operation with UTAD and also led directly
to the joint work with Ferras (Minho) who is a former PhD student on this programme.

2.3 Support for equality and diversity
The Mathematical Sciences Unit promotes equality and diversity, with a support strategy aligned
with the University’s Athena SWAN Bronze award and the HR Excellence in Research award as well
as the Navajo Merseyside and Cheshire LGBTI Charter Mark and the Disability Confident Employer
scheme. Three permanent staff members of the Unit (Antonopoulou, Karakatsani, Taylor) are female
mathematicians, and Antonopoulou is a member of European Women in Mathematics. The
University of Chester has always had a significant number of female students in Mathematics, which
is also reflected in our postgraduate population. We also draw attention to the impact of our part
time doctoral programme on widening participation and supporting a diverse student population.

The University’s REF code of practice has been followed to identify staff and outputs. All eligible
academic staff have been included in the Mathematical Sciences REF2021 submission. Selection
of outputs has been primarily based on self-assessment of quality by their authors. To enable
statistically significant monitoring against equality and diversity objectives, the data for Mathematical
Sciences is combined for analysis with other cognate units.

Current staff from the EU and overseas (5/8) continue to draw international students to the
university’s Mathematics Department. Multi-faith spaces, quiet rooms and quiet gardens are
available at Thornton and Exton Park, as are gender-neutral toilets and parent-and-baby rooms.
Thornton additionally has a specific quiet room designed for students with Aspergers/Autism. For
disabled staff and students, there are reserved parking spaces near to the entrances of most
buildings, as well as lifts and touch-activated doors, for example. The Facilities Team works with
staff and students to address any specific access issues encountered. There is also a wheelchair
accessible minibus that operates a shuttle service between Thornton and Exton Park. Mathematics
staff and students, together with those across the wider university, are supported by the Equality
Forum, Disabled Staff Group, Neurodiverse Student and Staff Support Group, Women's Network,
LGBT+ Staff Group, Parents' Network and Carers' Network. The annual Diversity Festival, which is
also open to members of the public, provides a focus through which the University actively promotes,
challenges and develops an understanding of equality, diversity and multiculturalism. The proximity
to industry facilitates research opportunities for disabled people and other underrepresented groups.

 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities


3.1 Mathematical Sciences income
The University of Chester continues to invest 100% of the research income it receives in support of
research. This enables a travel fund to be available for every member of the Mathematical Sciences
Group annually to support conference attendance and academic visits and visitors to enable
collaboration. Much of our work is of relatively low cost, and therefore the existing support
mechanisms are frequently able to support fully the development plans, which are carefully
monitored to ensure equality and diversity issues are addressed.


                                                                                                 Page 7

3.2 Infrastructure and facilities pertaining to research and research impact
The Mathematical Sciences Unit, housed at Thornton and Parkgate Campuses, has access to the
University’s high-speed internet connection, free Wi-Fi, Virtual Learning Environment, integrative AV
and whiteboards, as well as the many drop-in PC and Mac suites. There is also an excellent
specialist mathematics collection, including journals and e-resources, in the Sutton library at
Thornton Campus.

The main specialist resource available is the University’s high-performance computing
cluster, consisting of a combined processor power of 312 cores based on Intel Xeon E5 series @
2.5GHz CPUs with up to 530GB of memory. Cores are divided amongst 17 computer nodes linked
via high-speed infiniband interconnects. This is used by our research group for work involving parallel
algorithm development, including a recent PhD thesis by Nicola Banks, supervised by Ford.

Thornton Science Park is part of the Cheshire Science Corridor, which includes Alderley Park, where
one of our collaborators (Immunosys/Immundz) is based.
