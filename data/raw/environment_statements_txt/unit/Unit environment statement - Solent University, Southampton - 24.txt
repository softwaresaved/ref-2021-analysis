Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
 Institution: Solent University
 Unit of Assessment: 24 (Sport and Exercise Sciences, Leisure and Tourism)
 1.1 Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy
     1. A key aim of Solent University’s 2015-2020 strategy was to be “research informed and
         research active as a platform for our teaching”. In the 2020-2025 Strategic Plan, headed
         by a new Vice-Chancellor and supported by the newly appointed Pro Vice Chancellor for
         Research and Knowledge Exchange, research is at the core of Solent’s future direction.
         Unit of Assessment (UoA) 24 is one of the University’s most established research areas,
         and the 2021 submission builds upon the previous submission to UoA26 in 2014. The 2014
         submission focused on the Health, Sport and Exercise and Science research cluster and
         the Lawrie McMenemy Centre for Football Research. As the University pursued strategic
         growth in this UoA, these areas have developed and expanded into the themes outlined
         below, and the number of FTE submitting in 2021 has increased by 216%.

    2. Since 2014 the Faculty of Business, Sport and Enterprise has been re-configured into the
       School of Business and Law and the School of Sport, Health and Social Sciences, and
       Biomedical Science and Nursing have been introduced into the portfolio. For the current
       submission, the research outputs, impact case studies and research activity are aligned to
       the following themes:

        i)     Health and Wellbeing
        ii)    Inclusion in Sport and Leisure
        iii)   Enhancing Sport Performance

    3. As outlined in the institutional level environment statement (paragraph 14), Solent’s 2015-
       2020 strategy set a number of aims. These have acted as the driver for research
       development in UoA24, and are discussed in turn below.

 1.2 Establishing a strong focus for research and innovation
     4. Several research focused activities have been adopted to ensure a change in culture to
        support the growth of the UoA. This has included the development of research groups, an
        increase in the number of academics on a research trajectory and aligned to the
        University’s academic research career pathway, increased bidding activity, and support for
        research from the Research Office, including provision of research development
        opportunities and workshops.

 1.3 Development of cross-institutional research groups
     5. The Lawrie McMenemy Centre has expanded and several new research groups have
        formed. These comprise established researchers, doctoral students and early career
        researchers (ECRs), providing opportunities for cross-disciplinary discourse and support
        for doctoral students and ECRs through collaboration and dialogue. The research groups
        enable academics to work collaboratively and foster an interdisciplinary approach around
        the key themes, supporting the development of outputs, funding applications and PhD
        supervision.

       Lawrie McMenemy Centre for Football Research
    6. The Lawrie McMenemy Centre for Football Research focuses on football education,
       research and consultancy and aligns to the sport and leisure theme. The Centre has
       established links which provide expert support for the football industry and students, as
       well as professional development of football. Elliot, Magrath and Powis supported an
       impact case study through their focus on inclusion in football, while Webber provides an
       academic understanding of the political economy of football and Turner is working on safe
       standing and inclusive spaces for fans.

       Mind-Body Connections Research Group
    7. This is a multidisciplinary research group that explores mind-body connections and links
       to the theme of enhancing sport performance. Its goal is a holistic approach to the

                                                                                           Page 1
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
        evaluation of the human experience in an ecologically valid and translatable manner. The
        group considers varying aspects of human function. An example is research comparing
        the relationship between brain function and behaviour in healthy populations and those
        with Parkinson’s disease, and the evaluation of interventions to optimise cognitive function.
        This group includes researchers from Psychology, Sports Psychology, Neuroscience,
        Physiology, Biomechanics and Biomedicine. It also supports seven PhD students and
        seven ECRs.

       Solent University Realist Research Group
    8. This group, led by Harris, brings together researchers interested in realist evaluation. It
       focuses on synthesis and research and contributes to the inclusion in sport and leisure
       and health and wellbeing themes. The group has been involved in evaluation projects
       such as the Local Area Coordination Isle of Wight Evaluation. It has strong external
       networks, including links with stakeholders such as the 2018 ‘Evaluation in sport, leisure
       and wellbeing; the power of knowledge exchange’ funded by the Leisure Studies
       Association (LSA) and attended by groups such as Solent Mind, Youth Sport Trust and
       SportEd. This group supports three PhD students and an ECR.

 1.4 Establish a strong focus for research and innovation in each school
     9. The numbers of FTE contributing outputs to UoA24 has grown substantially year on year,
        with 46 outputs submitted to REF2021. These were selected from 77 outputs submitted by
        researchers for external review, in accordance with the University’s Code of Practice. The
        UoA has been supported by the development of more formal structures within the School,
        such as the School Advisory Group for Research (SAGR). SAGR comprises research
        active academics who represent all programme areas. It is committed to: (1) supporting
        and developing research themes; (2) supporting an integrated and interdisciplinary
        research culture; (3) reviewing research bids; (4) supporting the development of impact
        case studies; and (5) organising key research events. Other measures to support research
        within the ambit of the UoA include research development workshops run by the Research
        Office in collaboration with experienced academic staff, and an annual two days/nights
        research retreat, facilitated by the School Research Lead and Dean. These retreats, which
        are held off campus, support academics to write, as well as to provide support to each
        other.

 1.5 To improve our external reputation for research and innovation
     10. Across the three themes, researchers have worked with a range of external organisations,
         as described below.

        Health and Wellbeing
    11. Researchers in the UoA have contributed to expert groups to advise the UK Chief Medical
        Officer on muscle strength guidelines (Steele and Fisher). Steele was subsequently
        appointed as Principal Investigator for UKActive’s Research Institute, while also continuing
        to work part-time at Solent. This appointment resulted from ongoing work with the Institute,
        including collaboration on two randomised trials examining community-based resistance
        training interventions. This ongoing collaboration has provided opportunities for Steele and
        Fisher. Researchers whose work aligns to this theme also have collaborations with
        Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, as well as with other domestic and international
        higher education institutions (HEIs) including: The Open University, Leeds Becket
        University, Manchester Metropolitan University, University of Suffolk, Kent University,
        University Hospital of Southampton, University of Southern Maine, German Sport
        University Cologne, and Technical University Berlin. These collaborations will also support
        the sustainability of research within this UoA beyond 2021. In addition, researchers have
        a presence on editorial boards, including as managing editor and section editor for physical
        activity for health for both Registered Reports in Kinesiology and Communications in
        Kinesiology (Steele) and the editorial board for the Journal of Evolution and Health, guest
        editing for Frontiers in Neuroscience (Duncan) and external funding body reviewers
        including the Swiss National Science Foundation.

                                                                                              Page 2
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

        Inclusion in Sport and Leisure
    12. This theme includes academics researching the social science area of sport and leisure.
        This includes the work of Elliot, Magrath and Powis with the internationally recognised
        organisation, partly funded by the FA, ‘Kick It Out’. The research was used to develop an
        evidenced approach to tackling diversity in the football industry. Their work was
        incorporated into the Equality and Diversity in football award, which has led to greater
        awareness in issues of equity and diversity in the football industry. This partnership forms
        one of the impact case studies for this UoA submission. Within this theme a number of
        researchers are working on issues on equity and diversity in sport, including Powis working
        with UCLAN on disability sport and classification, and Magrath working on LGBTQ+
        people’s experiences in sport. Magrath is also equity and diversity lead for The Football
        Collective, a dedicated network of people bringing critical debate to football. Webber is a
        member of the Political Studies Association of Sport and Politics group and sub editor of
        the Football Collective. Addie is a member of the Leisure Studies Executive Committee,
        while Turner is co-convenor of the BSA Leisure Research Group. There are now several
        ECRs who are developing their research specialisms in this area, including gender and
        transgender athletes’ experiences of sport and leisure, and Freirean approaches to
        designing sport development. These ECRs are supported by the growing networks and
        events held at Solent. For example, in 2019 Solent hosted the International Sport and
        Discrimination conference. Solent University will also host the 2021 Leisure Studies
        Association Annual Conference, with the organising committee comprising researchers
        from UoA24. The theme of the conference is Leisure Identities, with a strong focus on
        understanding issues of inclusion in an era of austerity. These activities enable a research
        environment which celebrates and foregrounds the research in this theme and the growth
        of the Unit within and across the University.

        Enhancing Sport Performance
    13. University investment has enabled the building and equipping of a state-of-the-art Sports
        Complex (2019), nursing simulator suite, and biomedical laboratories. These specialist
        facilities have supported those working in the research groups, for example the Mind-Body
        Connections Research Group, as well as researchers in psychology, for example Neil on
        Auditory and Memory. In 2021, the British Association Sport and Exercise Science
        (BASES) student conference will be hosted by Solent with the theme of equity and diversity
        and inclusion in sport science. The BASES student conference is organised by researchers
        who are submitting as part of this UoA and was awarded to Solent due to researchers’
        active involvement in BASES (Wright and Mosely are both members of BASES and are
        BASES accredited; Hawkey is Deputy Chair and a Director BASES, and chairs the BASES
        Division of Biomechanics and Motor Behaviour and the Biomechanics Interest Group
        (BIG)).

    14. The work of those submitted in UoA24 is grounded in this robust research environment
        and the development of ECRs is placed at the heart of the theme to enable growth beyond
        REF2021 towards future REF submissions, thus enhancing the sustainability of research
        in this UoA.

 1.6 Maximise our external research income
     15. Details provided below in section 3 at 3.2

 1.7 Recruit and retain excellent colleagues
     16. Since the previous REF a targeted and strategic approach to academic recruitment,
         including fostering the growth in the number academics with a doctorate has led to
         increased research capacity within the Unit. Key to this have been the University’s support
         for staff to undertake doctoral studies, and the strategic recruitment of academics with
         PhDs and a record of strong research outputs. Most of these appointments have taken
         place at the ECR stage. This move to including research-related criteria in advertisements


                                                                                             Page 3
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
        and questioning at interview for academic roles reflects a shift for Solent University. It
        resulted in 10 out of the 18.41 FTE submitted to UoA24 being appointed to
        academic/research positions since 2015.

 1.8 Recognise and reward excellence
     17. The introduction of the career pathways in 2018 supported academics to pursue their
         research ambitions, including through an annual round for promotions. The research
         pathway has ensured that academics to have time to focus on research-related activity,
         which has increased outputs, enabled the development of research groups and allowed
         time to develop research bids. It has, therefore, placed increased value on research in the
         School and University more widely. All researchers submitting to UoA24 are on the
         research pathway, in accordance with the Solent REF Code of Practice.

 1.9 Future Aims for 2020-2025
     18. The UoA submission has developed considerably since 2014, and for the next REF cycle
         the focus will be on building on the gains of recent years to maintain the sustainability of
         the research culture to ensure that it continues to grow. Specifically, this will include:
     • Embedding a positive and inclusive research culture through supporting academics’
         research activities. This will include providing more opportunities for collaborative research
         through effective research groups, enabling policies and processes
     • Growth of UoA submissions for biomedical research and nursing to broaden the research
         profile at Solent and support submission to relevant UoAs in future REF exercises
     • Support, showcase and celebrate academics’ research activity: for example, through the
         Emergence of Research Coffee Morning and Research Group Seminar Series
     • Increase the number of academics involved in internationally excellent or world leading
         research
     • Increase the number of bids submitted and income from research and research-related
         activity: for example, through optimisation of the use of Research Office support, training
         and development, the growing strength of the research groups, and the increased use of
         peer review systems in the development of bids
     • Establishment of a UoA Lead to meet regularly with the new Faculty Research Strategic
         Lead and convene UoA research meetings to facilitate cross-disciplinary sharing of ideas
         and external partnerships to address real-world issues

 2. People
     19. This section reflects on how the Institutional and School strategies to support the
         development of researchers have been implemented in respect of researchers aligned to
         UoA24. This also includes consideration of recently recruited ECR academics who are not
         submitted to UoA24 in this REF cycle, but who demonstrate the ongoing growth and
         direction of travel within the research culture and research base for the Unit and reflect the
         ambitions to continue to grow UoA24 for future REF submission.

 2.1 Research Career Pathway
     20. The University career pathways, launched in 2018, include a research pathway for
         academics, with clear objectives aligned at all career stages. Academics on the research
         pathway have research aligned through Performance Development Reviews (PDRs) and
         through increasing research capacity, and each receive 300 hours in their Academic Work
         Plan to support research activity. This reflects a cultural shift to allow academics time for
         research as well as signalling the University’s intention to support research development.
         In addition to including clear objectives aligned at all stages of career development, the
         research pathway is intended to be agile and flexible. As such, academics can apply to
         join the research career pathway annually.

 2.2 PGR Completions
     21. Within the Unit there have been two doctoral completions during the REF period. The
         recruitment to the doctoral programme during the review period has been increasing


                                                                                                Page 4
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
        modestly, with eleven doctoral students currently registered in the UoA and further
        planned support for increased recruitment including institutional investment in a bursary
        scheme.

 2.3 PGR support
     22. Postgraduate students are supported by a supervisory team with up to three supervisors
         who must have a minimum of two completions. PGR students are further supported by the
         Research Office and the Doctoral Researcher Development Programme (DRDP). The
         DRDP includes induction (milestones and research integrity) and the University also
         subscribes to doctoral researcher development training delivered through five modules
         forming part of the University of East Anglia virtual online training. Students are also
         supported through more formal processes, such as annual monitoring and review, which
         is conducted by members of the School Doctoral Review Panel.

 2.4 Researcher Development Programme
     23. The Researcher Development Programme (RDP) is intended to help researchers at all
         stages of their research careers and is designed around the following broad thematic
         areas; developing your research, funding your research, communicating your research,
         professional development, and doctoral supervisory training. The RDP sessions and
         resources are open to doctoral students as well as academic staff, promoting a collegiate
         and inclusive researcher environment. A new researcher development plan, implemented
         in 2020, offers further support for the development of individual research plans and
         promotes discussions about any support needed to grow. This is supported within the UoA
         by the Unit Lead and School Research Leads and contributes to the sustainability of
         research growth within UoA24.

 2.5 Staff Development
     24. Since 2014, there has been a significant investment in staff development in the School, for
         example through the provision of support for attendance at conferences and other research
         professional development events. Academics within the UoA have been supported to
         attend and present their research both nationally and internationally, and examples include
         the International Sociology of Sport Conference (Turner), the European Association for
         Sociology of Sport Conference (Elliot, Webber, Magrath, Szerovay), the International
         Association for Critical Realism Conference (Harris), the BASES Annual Conference
         (Mosely, Wright), the North American Sociology of Sport Association Conference (Turner),
         the American College of Sport Medicine Conference (Steele), the Early Career Scientist
         Symposium (Moody), and the Vista Paralympic Conference (Powis). Support for
         academics’ study for a PhD at Solent (or elsewhere), which is a central tenet of the
         University’s 2015-2020 strategy, enabled three academics aligned to the UoA to complete
         PhDs during the period. More broadly across the School, since 2014, 29 academics have
         been supported to complete their PhDs, demonstrating a commitment to the development
         of research active academics.

 2.6 Research Mentoring
     25. A research mentoring programme organised through SAGR has been implemented to
         support researchers and is open to those at any stage of their career.

 2.7 Equity and Diversity
     26. The Unit has reviewed the approach to equality and diversity in accordance with the Solent
         REF Code of Practice. In REF2021, four FTE academics (21% of the submitted
         researchers in the Unit) are female. While this remains a small proportion of the overall
         submission, it represents a substantial increase on 2014, which included no women. A key
         research theme of the Unit focuses on inclusivity in relation to gender, LGBTQ+ and race,
         and an Associate Professor in Equality and Diversity was recently appointed within the
         School. The School is committed to furthering and embedding equality and diversity
         principles across the researcher profile. The proportion of female staff submitted is now
         closer to the sector average for researchers in sports science (HESA 2018/19 data 36%

                                                                                             Page 5
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
        female). This is an area which this UoA will focus on, through mentoring and as part of the
        wider University equity and diversity strategy (see paragraph 34 in the institutional level
        environment statement).

 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities
     27. While income generation remains a challenge for UoA24, the career pathways strategy
         and the development of research groups mean that the infrastructure supporting
         researchers and their expertise are both growing and will enable future successful bids.

 3.1 External Funding
     28. For the period 2013/14 to 2018/19, the Unit generated £77,000 in funding returned to
         HESA. A summary of research bids is provided below, which shows a trajectory towards
         more bidding. This is supported by adopting the following approach:
            1) Working with the Research Office at an early stage
            2) Collaborative bidding through the research groups
            3) Collaborative bidding with external partners (HEIs and local partners)
            4) Utilising facilities and infrastructure
     29. This area has been identified as a priority for development of the UoA. The current
         research profile of those in UoA24 and the thematic focus will enable a more strategic
         approach to research income for the next REF.

 3.2 Bid Development
         External Bids
     30. Since the previous REF exercise, 28 research and consultancy bids have been submitted
         from within the UoA. Successful bids included Magrath on Investigating the experiences
         of LGBT soccer fans (Inclusion in Sport and Leisure theme) and Moody, Microbial
         Degradation of Marine Plastics, (Health and Wellbeing theme). While many externally
         submitted bids have not been successfully funded, the increase in submissions
         demonstrates growth in research capacity and trajectory. This will be a key area of focus
         for the next REF cycle, aligned to the new research strategy 2020-2025, and supported
         through further development of the research groups as well as the external collaborations
         discussed in 4.1 below. The development of research groups and the SAGR has included
         the implementation of internal peer review in the bid development stage, supported by the
         central bid support provided by the Research Office, building depth and breadth of
         researcher development in the bidding and funding landscape.

        Support for Researcher Development in Income and Bidding
    31. The Researcher Development Programme supports researchers across the University. As
        indicated in 2.4 above, it includes workshops designed to support researchers through the
        bidding process. In addition, internal support for research has included support for seed
        funding bids. Researchers have benefitted from internal Starter, Accelerator and Catapult
        funding. This internal funding has supported researcher development within the UoA, on a
        range of topics such as gender in sport, community health, coaching, haptic
        communication for dancers and brain activity during goal oriented tasks in older adults
        (Steele, Wimshurst, Michailidis, Duncan), and with a particular focus on supporting the
        work of researchers at an early stage of their careers across the period.

 3.3 New Sports Building
     32. The new sports building (completed in 2018) offers opportunities for researchers in UoA24
         through supporting the themes of Health and Wellbeing and Enhancing Sport
         Performance. The £28 million Solent Sports Complex includes a number of specialist
         facilities in two sports halls, such as sports clinics for sport therapy students, a teaching
         gym and performance analysis technologies. Both the Health and Wellbeing and
         Enhancing Sport Performance themes benefit from these facilities, which enable
         researchers in UoA24 to plan sustainable research projects and develop more
         collaborations. Thus far, the new sports building (which also houses a conference room
         and offices for testing) has been used in research within the Enhancing Sport Performance

                                                                                               Page 6
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)
          theme. For example, a workshop was held for High Performance Athletes to educate them
          about slow paced breathing and stress, and Duncan and Mosley are currently preparing
          the related publication.

 3.4 BASES accredited labs
     33. The physiology laboratory is accredited by BASES and was used for some of the research
         included in REF (Wright, Mosely, Fisher). The physiology and biomechanics labs are
         regularly used for testing with external clients. Clients include Swindon Town FC,
         Hampshire Cricket and Runners and Cyclists. This has also led to income generation which
         has been used for research support (e.g. equipment, conferences): examples include
         Southampton FC £26,870.40; and equipment such as an Anti-Gravity treadmill and Body
         Composition Pod. This again provides a sustainable approach to building future resilience
         of research in the UoA.

 3.5 Biomedical and Nutrition Labs
     34. Biomedical laboratories support teaching and research in biomedical science and nutrition,
         which are new areas to the School as outlined in section 1.1 above. Equipment includes
         spectrophotometers for analytical biochemistry, PCR and gel electrophoresis
         running/imaging systems for molecular biology, and a range of microscopes for cell biology
         and pathology. These facilities support the work of Moody, Baldock and Taraban. As noted
         in section 1, this research will be developed into a sustainable submission for a relevant
         UoA in future REF cycles.

 3.6 Research Hub
     35. Academics in this UoA were able to access to the Researcher Launchpad for meetings,
         seminars, workshops and networking.


 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society

 4.1
       36. The nature of the cross-disciplinary research of this UoA is underpinned by the drive to
           engage with and promote long-term and meaningful partnerships and collaborations with
           researchers in academia (locally, nationally and internationally), community enterprises
           and other bodies. Researchers within the Unit have excellent connections with local
           groups, which have been discussed above in relation to the research themes. While some
           of these connections are well established, others are in the formative stages and the Unit
           will continue to develop and grow these to support further collaborations and enable
           greater contributions to the economy and society. The introduction of the University’s civic
           charter in 2020 will also help guide these collaborations.

 4.2 HEI Collaborations
     37. Researchers in this UoA have established several collaborations with national and
         international HEIs which support research. For example, 32 of the outputs submitted to
         this UoA are co-authored and reflect collaborations with other HEIs including,
         internationally; the Federal University of Goias (Fisher), the University of Pittsburgh
         (Baldock), Queensland University of Technology (Duncan), the German Sport University
         (Mosely), and the University of Jwvaskyla (Szerovay). In the UK, Collaborations include
         UKActive (Steele), the University of Sussex (Baldock), and UClan (Powis). These
         collaborations reflect the foundations of partnerships which will be utilised for continued
         research collaborations but will also support the strategy outlined in 3.1 to develop
         collaborative funding opportunities. For example, Duncan is currently collaborating with
         Kent University on a body of work focusing on mobile brain imaging and Parkinson’s
         disease and through such collaborations will develop a sustained body of research and
         potential collaborative funding.

 4.3 Health and Wellbeing
    38. Since 2014, focus and priority has been given to the growth and development of
        researchers who align with UoA24. Depth of expertise and visibility of success achieved
        has and continues to be developed, with greater detail and information on the public facing
        website, celebration and promotion of success on local radio and through greater
        engagement by staff in research and knowledge exchange activities. An example of this is
        Steele, who was invited in 2018 to join the Chief Medical Officers’ Expert Working Group
        (EWG) to review the 2011 CMO Physical Activity Guidelines for Adults. Steele has an
        extensive range of networks which support his research and the research of Fisher.
        Similarly, since 2014 Solent has supported the ABP Southampton Marathon. The Meet the
        Expert sessions run by academics as part of this event provide an opportunity to share
        research-based approaches to training for all. These events are free to attend and reflect
        examples of publicly sharing research through open access/seminars. Other examples of
        contribution to society in this theme include: Duncan, who has spoken about her work with
        the local University of the 3rd Age (group for 60+), has secured an Honorary Research
        Contract with Southern Health Foundation Trust, and was ranked top 10 internationally by
        Brain Products Germany for her published work, “Validation of a multidirectional
        locomotive dual-task paradigm to evaluate task-related differences in event-related
        electro-cortical activity”.

 4.4 Inclusion in Sport and Leisure
     39. Solent research underpinned Kick It Out’s “Equality and Diversity Awareness in Football
         Award”, an educational programme which has trained over 70 football industry
         professionals since its launch in 2015. This is now a central component of Kick It Out’s
         work. Turner’s work on Safe Standing in football was included in Standing at Football: A
         Rapid Evidence Assessment report, commissioned for DCMS. Magrath’s research on
         inclusive sexualities in sport includes working with fan groups to explore issues of inclusion.
         This has appeared in the HuffPost and Outsports.

 4.5 Enhancing Sport Performance
     40. Within the area of performance and wellbeing in sport, a greater sense of identity has
         begun to develop, with key areas of strength and academics with expertise being identified.
         This will enable a more strategic approach to the identification of key funding and PhD
         opportunities to further develop and expand this key theme for following REF cycles. Wright
         currently runs the BASES workshops (four annually) for new supervisees, supervisors and
         reviewers as part of the Supervised Experience Programme. This allows participants to
         become BASES Accredited Sports Scientists. Wright also has external collaborations with
         Blackburn Rovers FC and AFC Bournemouth. It is intended to develop these partnerships
         to provide more pathways to impact in this UoA in future.

 4.6 Summary
     41. UoA24 has been established as a cornerstone of the University’s REF submission. It has
         continued to grow and develop through this REF cycle by adopting a targeted focus on the
         three core themes of Health & Wellbeing, Inclusion in Sport and Leisure, and Enhancing
         Sport Performance. This strategy has supported targeted investment and enhancement
         activity across the UoA in both recruitment and the development of staff, and investment
         in key infrastructure and resources. This has fostered an ambitious research culture,
         engaging competitively and collaboratively with the external research landscape. The Unit
         has built and grown productive research groups, underpinned by the School Advisory
         Group for Research, and is positioned advantageously to further capitalise on this growth
         in the future.
