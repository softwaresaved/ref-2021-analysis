UNIT-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (REF5B)
 Institution: University of Nottingham

 Unit of Assessment: UoA26 – Modern Languages and Linguistics

 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy

OVERVIEW

The Department of Modern Languages and Cultures (MLC) sits in the School of Cultures, Languages
and Area Studies, one of three schools in the Faculty of Arts. The Head of Department oversees
research, together with the Director of Research, the Impact Officer and the Director of PGR. All sit
on the relevant School committees to ensure the unit’s research and impact strategies are aligned
with School, Faculty and University priorities. MLC is the result of the merger in 2017 of four language
departments and has 33 (31.2 FTE) research staff working across French, German, Portuguese,
Russian, Spanish, Dutch, Serbian/Croatian, Slovene and Chinese. Our research ranges from
medieval to contemporary studies, with strengths in literature, linguistics, translation, Cuba,
Lusophone studies, post-conflict, postcolonialism, and critical theory. Three interdisciplinary
Research Centres – the Centre for Translation and Comparative Cultural Studies (CTCCS), the
Centre for the Study of Post-Conflict Societies (Post-Conflict Centre) and the Centre for Research
on Cuba (Cuba Centre) – channel collaborations, grant capture, PGR and ECR recruitment, impact
and KE. MLC staff have helped drive the University’s Beacons of Excellence and Interdisciplinary
Research Clusters (IRCs) (see Institutional Statement [IS], 2.1): MLC co-directed the Languages,
Texts and Society Research Priority Area, co-leads the Creative and Digital IRC, is on the
Leadership Team of the Future Food Beacon, and on the board of the Improving Health and
Wellbeing IRC.

ACHIEVEMENT OF STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 2014–2020

1.1 RESEARCH

The unit’s core strategy is to sustain research excellence and diversity by fostering individual
scholarship and building up collaborative research and impact. The three key priorities established
in REF2014 remain in force. The first priority, to strengthen cross-language synergies, was
achieved through the creation of the new Department and the restructuring of research into five
cross-language research areas – literature; history, memory and post-conflict; theory and intellectual
history; audio-visual culture; and linguistics and translation. These areas anticipate disciplinary and
societal challenges and build on our established decolonising and decentred approach to the
cultures on which we work. Responding to the University’s global research engagement ambition
(IS, 2.1d), the second priority, to extend regional, national and international collaborations, was
met through collaboration with 11+ departments across UoN’s Nottingham, China and Malaysia
campuses (see 4.4), and through larger, funded external collaborations (total £497k), such as the
European Union ‘Memosur’ project, the Leverhulme International Research Network ‘Landscapes of
Realism’, and the AHRC OWRI project ‘Multilingualism: Empowering Individuals, Transforming
Societies’. These initiatives deepened our impact and KE activities and led to further collaborations,
e.g. Stockey’s involvement in MEMORYLAB and McLelland’s ‘World of Languages’ work (4.1 and
4.3). The third priority, to increase external research income through national and international
research collaboration, was delivered with a £267k increase (3.1). Following REF2014 feedback,
a fourth priority was established: to improve postgraduate research culture. Through better
recruitment, monitoring and training, PhD completions increased by 57% (2.3).
These objectives have been achieved with 39 research awards (54% to women, 46% to men; 56%
to Associate Professors, 23% to Professors, 21% to Assistant Professors), supporting 26
monographs, 24 edited volumes/special journal issues, and 140 journal articles and book chapters
across five research areas.



                                                                                                Page 1
UNIT-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (REF5B)
In Literature, an established Nottingham MLC strength, highlights include Roberts’s Lorca
biography, Göttsche’s ‘Landscapes of Realism’ project, Bartel’s Men Writing Eating Disorders,
Miranda’s The Personal Infinitive, Sabine’s José Saramago, García’s Space and the Postmodern
Fantastic in Contemporary Literature, Kumaraswami’s The Social Life of Literature in Revolutionary
Cuba, Ridon’s L'Étrangement du voyageur, and Ford’s Nottingham French Studies special issue on
Bernardin de St Pierre. A cluster of work on literature and conflict includes Norris’s Haunted Serbia,
Zoric’s The Rhetoric of Exile, Frank’s articles on WWII Russian literary émigrés, Mertens’s on
Mortier’s Marcel, and Göttsche’s three co-edited volumes on postcolonialism. In History, memory,
and post-conflict, research from all language areas on the interface between culture and power
includes Hitchcott’s Rwanda Genocide Stories (Leverhulme and AHRC awards); the Leverhulme
project ‘Beyond Havana’ (Kapcia, with Kumaraswami) and Kapcia’s monographs, Leadership in the
Cuban Revolution and A Short History of Revolutionary Cuba; Stockey’s articles on Franco’s Spain;
Collins’s on the history of violence in Brazil; and White’s Leverhulme-funded work on medieval
Byzantium-Rus relations.

In Theory and intellectual history, work in literary, political, technological, cultural, gender and
feminist studies continues the interdisciplinary Nottingham Critical Theory tradition. Achievements
include Johnson’s ‘French Cybernetics’ and Gilonne’s L’Apocalypse déçoit on French philosophy
and technology; Still’s Derrida and Other Animals and special journal issue on disorderly eating;
Lane’s Republican Citizens, Precarious Subjects and Marks’s articles on work in France. In German,
Oergel produced Zeitgeist. How Ideas Travel (Leverhulme-funded), Carroll Anthropology's
Interrogation of Philosophy from the Eighteenth to the Twentieth Century, while in Ibero-American
studies Sharman published Deconstructing the Enlightenment in Spanish America, and Vidal
Bouzon, A Galiza (não) é longe daqui...?. Identified as a growing presence in REF2014, Audio-
visual culture has been strengthened with the appointments of Hegarty and ECR Harries. Spanning
French, German, Russian and Spanish, research stretches from direct visual material analysis,
through adaptation theory, to biography. Work includes: Hegarty’s Annihilating Noise and Peter
Gabriel, McMichael’s on Soviet/Russian rock music, Uecker’s on Weimar Republic visual culture,
Palfreyman’s on Reitz's Die andere Heimat, Shingler’s The French Art Novel, 1900–1930,
Lawrance’s work on the painter Carducho, and Andrews’s Painting and Devotion, the first book in
English for 50 years on the painter Morales.

Finally, Linguistics and translation has since 2014 developed major grant-capture and impact
capacity. McLelland’s AHRC and BA projects yielded two monographs, including the first
comprehensive history of language learning and teaching in Britain, plus a three-volume edited
collection (with Smith, Warwick). McLelland was Co-I of the AHRC project ‘Multilingualism:
Empowering Individuals, Transforming Societies’. Linguistics has been strengthened by Walsh in
French (monograph: Linguistic Purism) and post-doc Hui Zhao in Chinese. In Translation Studies,
the Centre for Translation and Comparative Cultural Studies underpinned Batchelor’s volumes,
Translating Frantz Fanon and China and Africa; ECR Gray’s work on translating science fiction; and
Mével’s Subtitling African American Vernacular English into French.

The unit actively encourages work on equality, diversity and inclusion, e.g. Collins’s on black history,
Sabine’s on LGBT poetry, and postdoctoral fellow Smith’s on inclusive education in Cuba. The
individual creativity that remains the bedrock of MLC research has been stimulated by collaboration
within research areas and cross-pollination between them, e.g. the annual MLC conference: ‘Other
68s’ (2018), ‘Modernist Art Writing/Writing Modernist Art’ (2019), ‘Emotions, Memory and Media in
Comparative Literature’ (COVID-postponed). Other events include six Luso-Hispanic Tate Lectures
(e.g. by former Ambassador to Brazil, Alan Charlton), and Languages, Texts and Society’s three
conferences, four PGR-led conferences and nine workshops. In total we ran 46 conferences,
including ‘Parler et habiter ensemble’ with Luce Irigaray (2015).

100+ academic and non-academic visitors enriched our research environment. 13 men and 11
women have given MLC Research Seminars since 2017. There were two Visiting Fellows/Professors
(e.g. Kibbee, Leverhulme) and 10 Visiting Special Professors – French VSPs running an
interdisciplinary conference in their final year. Prize-winning translators Margaret Jull Costa’s and


                                                                                                Page 2
UNIT-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (REF5B)
Anthea Bell’s UoN connections were recognised with Honorary Degrees. The ‘Encounter: Writers
and Authors in Translation’ series hosted seven international authors and their translators.

1.2 IMPACT

A key strategic development has been the expansion of impact and KE activities. Underpinned by
infrastructural improvements (3.3), Research Centres and seed funding (e.g. £40k from Santander),
a supportive environment facilitated: Mével’s collaboration with English, Computer Science and Red
Earth Theatre on an inclusive project providing technological access to theatre for D/deaf audiences;
Hegarty’s seven music events with cultural sector partners; two Zarzuela concerts (Andrews); the
Post-Conflict Centre’s work with Falklands/Malvinas War veterans (four events), and two major
initiatives on Spanish Civil War archaeology with Spanish policymakers, practitioners and museums
(see 4.2, 4.3).

The three impact case studies demonstrate the breadth of our research and different facets of our
approach to achieving impact. ‘Providing Intelligence on Cuba to Shape Policy and to Inform
Governmental Communities and Journalistic Practice’ (ICS1) influenced government policy
nationally and internationally through an established Research Centre (Cuba Centre) and media
engagement. ‘“Hungry for Words”: Using Narratives to Transform How Eating Disorders in Men and
Boys Are Understood in Healthcare, Education, and by Creative Practitioners’ (ICS2) influenced the
attitudes and policies of healthcare institutions and practitioners, charities and schools through
partnerships with charities and media companies, direct school engagement, and an
Interdisciplinary Research Cluster (Improving Health and Wellbeing). With major funding
sponsorship and postdoctoral support, ‘Reshaping How Language Learning and Multilingualism
Are Valued and Understood’ (ICS3) raised public awareness of multilingualism and influenced the
debate on language teaching policy, producing an exhibition (3000+ attendees) and an open access
teachers’ journal issue (40,000+ views).

1.3 RESEARCH AND IMPACT OBJECTIVES 2020–2025

RESEARCH

The Department’s key research objectives are:
   • to support colleagues at all career stages to produce excellent individual, impactful
      research
   • to sustain a thriving PGR culture at a challenging moment for the discipline
   • to continue to embed EDI principles and practices
   • to enable high-quality research through grant-capture at all career stages
   • to maximise the benefits of collaborative interdisciplinary research
   • to ensure that, whatever the research, consideration is always given to languages
   • to respond to societal challenges, by extending work on Health Humanities, culture and
      technology, and social cohesion
   • to expand Open Access capacity, in line with UKRI’s 2020 review


These objectives inform staffing strategy and research area plans:
In Literature, expected monographs include New Canons: Zeitgeist and Cultural Transfer (Oergel);
plus studies of images of dissidence in Yugoslavia (Zoric), émigrés in Nazi-occupied France (Frank),
counter-cultural travel narratives (Ridon), Unamuno’s politics (Roberts), literature beyond Havana
(Kumaraswami) and Different Stories of Illness (Bartel). Roberts will participate in a Spanish
Government-funded project, ‘Narrativas en transición’. Bartel is CoI in a £4m interdisciplinary bid
(AHRC and Medical RC) for ‘Adolescence, Mental Health and the Developing Mind’ (see also
IMPACT).
In History, memory, and post-conflict, key outputs will be White’s The Special Relationship:
Byzantium and Rus, c. 860-1453 (CUP), Collins’s Enslaved Motherhood and Emancipatory
Narratives (Liverpool UP), Miranda’s Transitions: Film, Literature and Politics in Argentina, Chile and

                                                                                               Page 3
UNIT-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (REF5B)
Brazil, and Hirsekorn’s work on GDR Free German Youth functionaries. Miranda will bid with the
Global South Research Centre (Cologne) for a project with Falklands/Malvinas veterans, while
Kumaraswami will oversee the digitisation of the unique Hennessy Collection (see 3.3).

In Theory and intellectual history, projects will include the relationship between Enlightenment
psychology and German philosophy (Carroll), ‘Queer Portugal since the 1974 Revolution’ (Sabine),
representations of Iberian post-Transitions (Vidal Bouzon), and ‘The Agony of Liberalism’ (Roberts,
Sharman and Vidal Bouzon). Gilonne will publish Futurs antérieurs, and Vidal Bouzon, Sharman and
Shingler Other ‘68s (Peter Lang).

In Audio-visual culture, planned monographs include Francophonia (Hegarty); studies of Russian
musical counterculture (McMichael), Lotte Reiniger (Palfreyman), Zarzuela and the Spanish Empire,
and Painting in Iberian convents 1550–1750 (Andrews). Hegarty plans bids for ‘Francophonia’
(AHRC) and ‘The Future of Live Experimental Performance’ (EPSRC), and will continue to co-lead
the Creative and Digital IRC.

In Linguistics and translation, Walsh will publish on French language columns, and, following the
MEITS project, McLelland on attitudes to norms in German. In Translation, planned monographs
include studies of the sociology of literary translation (Gray) and transfiction (Mével). McLelland will
seek funding for under-explored areas (bilingual lexicography in Europe, and Chinese-European
linguistic relations) to create postdoctoral positions. Two ECR successes already include a Marie
Curie award (Stojanov, £171k, March 2021) studying the standardisation of Croatian, and Hellewell’s
ESRC Fellowship in Translation (£112.1k, Oct 2020).

IMPACT

The work underpinning the case studies and other impact initiatives will be extended. With AHRC
follow-on funding (£90.7k; COVID-extended June 2021), McLelland will continue to embed the
history of language teaching and learning in teacher training and CPD, and to promote language
learning and multilingualism through an exhibition and local partnerships. New lines of impact have
been and will continue to be nurtured through three principal mechanisms. a) The Annual Research
Forum (2019) identified several projects with impact potential, particularly Mével’s on immersive
technologies for D/deaf audiences. b) Research Centres: Kumaraswami will develop the Cuba
Centre’s impact, her wellbeing research offering synergies with Bartel (below), while Miranda’s
collaborations with war veterans, institutions and NGOs in Argentina and the UK will advance Post-
Conflict’s impact agenda. c) Strategic IRC roles: Bartel’s role in the Improving Health and Wellbeing
IRC made her PI for the Global Challenge Research project (phase two) on South African healthcare
training (see 4.3). Hegarty’s co-leadership of the Creative and Digital IRC will enable him to develop
impact projects in audio culture and global experimental music, and MLC to develop interdisciplinary
impact work closely informed by UoN’s Digital Research Strategy (IS, 2.1c). The unit’s impact work
currently involves three men and three women and is split evenly between Professors and Associate
Professors. These experienced colleagues, also using the three mechanisms above, will mentor
ECR colleagues working on impact to achieve a sustainable impact culture.

We will use all the mechanisms at our disposal, including supporting extensions to funded projects
(McLelland, Hegarty), to enable colleagues particularly affected by COVID-19 to pursue their work
(see 2.4).
1.4 INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH, OPEN RESEARCH, RESEARCH ETHICS AND INTEGRITY
Building on a strong tradition of interdisciplinarity, the Department has supported interdisciplinary
research through its Research Centres, e.g. Post-Conflict working with Politics, History and Law;
participation in University Beacons of Excellence, e.g. Future Foods (Bartel); and involvement in and
leadership of Interdisciplinary Research Clusters, e.g. Languages, Texts and Society (20
colleagues), Creative and Digital (four), and Improving Health and Wellbeing, fundamental to Bartel’s
ICS. Other interdisciplinary collaborations, including with 11+ UoN Departments/Schools, are
outlined in 4.4.


                                                                                                Page 4
UNIT-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (REF5B)
The UoA has a healthy open research (OA) environment, with a history of OA publishing dating
back to 2009. School Research Committee oversees implementation of the University’s policies on
open access and research data management (IS, 2.3), with support for UKRI grant applicants’ data
management plans provided by the Library and Digital Transformations Hub. PGRs are also
supported to complete data management plans. Faculty funds Gold Open Access publishing, notably
McLelland’s 2015 monograph, and journal issues with Smith. MLC debated OA at a Research Forum
featuring OA expert Gary Hall (2019) and co-organised the full-day event ‘Open Access and the
Future of Scholarly Publishing in the Arts’ for staff, PGRs and experts to debate OA (May 2020:
COVID-cancelled). School DoR Still sat on the University’s Plan S working party, while the unit led
postgraduate OA training through the e-journal LTS, published OA since 2017. McLelland and
Hegarty sit on international OA presses. The UoA produced 66 OA outputs overall.

On research integrity, MLC is fully compliant with the Concordat to Support Research Integrity
(October 2019) and the University’s Code of Research Conduct and Research Ethics and
misconduct policies (IS, 2.4). Conduct and policy are guided also by Athena Swan. Ethical practice
is overseen by School Ethics Officer, MLC’s Miranda, who sits with DoR Sharman on the School’s
EDI and Research committees, which deal directly with research integrity. Best practice, informed
by UKRI Vitae research integrity code and training (attendee: Still), is shared through whole-
department meetings and online training. Beyond formal obligations, MLC researchers weave ethical
considerations into the fabric of their research: e.g. Bartel’s work including vulnerable individuals as
subjects rather than objects of research, and McLelland’s with multilingual refugees.

 2. People

2.1 STAFFING AND RECRUITMENT POLICY

Following the retirement of senior colleagues and moves (e.g. Hitchcott and Batchelor to Chairs at
St Andrews and UCL), strategic appointments were made at Chair level to secure senior research
leadership (Hegarty 2018, Kumaraswami 2020, French and Spanish respectively), and at Assistant
Professor level to develop new talent (Walsh, García, Harries, Gray); all these new colleagues have
permanent contracts. Kumaraswami’s appointment was succession-planning to secure the Cuba
Centre and create new impact potential. Hegarty and Harries strengthen Audio-visual culture. Initially
a Leverhulme postdoctoral fellowship, Walsh’s permanent post (2019) increases critical mass in
Linguistics. Two appointments expanded Translation research: ECR Gray (2019) replaced Batchelor
in French, while García also strengthened Comparative literature and Theory. The unit has
embedded EDI in the recruitment of outstanding researchers at all career stages: e.g. a fixed-term
cover post (Davies Hayon) allowed Harries to complete her Junior Research Fellowship at
Cambridge before joining UoN. Future recruitment priorities include junior posts to strengthen
Spanish history and Audio-visual culture.

The Department also prioritised the recruitment of postdoctoral fellows as a strategic investment in
the next generation of researchers. Of nine recruited (BA: Scott; Leverhulme: Krylova, Walsh, Garfi,
Serem and Smith; MHRA: Szypula; AHRC OWRI: Zhao; Nottingham Research Fellowship: Whitt),
four have permanent academic posts: Walsh with us, Serem in UoN History, Whitt in UoN English,
Smith at De Montfort. The unit offers two-year HONORARY RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS to recent PhD
students and those finishing post-docs or other fixed-term contracts (e.g. Scott covering maternity
leave) to help them transition to academic careers. Fellows enjoy library, space, computing and other
facilities, and work with an academic mentor. Seven (Clayfield, Martí Martínez, Story, L.Collins,
Scott, N.Sharman, and Runner) used this route. Cuban Studies postdoctoral fellows alone produced
one co-edited volume (Kirk, Story and Clayfield, Cuba’s Forgotten Decade) and two monographs
(Smith, Education, Citizenship, and Cuban Identity; and Story, When the Soviets Came to Town).

2.2 STAFF DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

MLC’s research staff development strategy involves providing well-conceived support underpinned
by an open, collegial ethos to create the maximum possible space for research activities and career


                                                                                                Page 5
UNIT-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (REF5B)
advancement. The strategy is delivered through policies, infrastructure and funding at School,
Faculty and University level, underwritten by the Concordat to Support the Career Development of
Researchers (IS, 3.1).
Policies to support permanent 1.0 and 0.8 FTE staff include: a designated research day per week;
one-in-seven semesters research leave; personal annual research allowance (£600); School
Research and Conference Fund allowance (up to £1,200 p.a.). For the one fixed-term (0.2)
researcher, support includes a pro rata research allowance, study leave entitlement, full School
Research and Conference Fund allowance, and the timetabling of research meetings (and UG
teaching) on one day.
Holistic staff development begins with mentoring. All new staff have a mentor; any member of staff
can also request a University-level mentor (e.g. Slade, UoN/NHS Institute of Mental Health,
mentored Bartel). Staff applying for grants are mentored by relevant academic mentors and the
Centre for Advanced Studies (CAS). Mentoring with senior colleagues to address specific obstacles
to progress is available to all; successful outcomes include two monographs (2020, 2021) plus
completed fieldwork leading to an article. Additional mentoring used by colleagues includes a writing
retreat and a writing group (2.4). ECRs are paired with experienced doctoral supervisors to learn
University procedures and best practice in PGR supervision.
As well as an assigned mentor, ECRs have a probationary period with workload planning
allowances, including a reduced administrative load in their first year designed to approximate a
two-thirds workload. All colleagues have appraisal opportunities, via the annual RESEARCH
INTERVIEW with Director of Research or Deputy to reflect on their year’s work and plans. More than
231 research interviews have provided mentoring and guidance. All staff also have APPRAISAL AND
DEVELOPMENT CONVERSATIONS (IS, 3.1), where promotion and career development are discussed.

Research staff development is also enabled through training opportunities. Training has been
crucial in succession planning. The unit’s investment in RESEARCH LEADERSHIP is evidenced by
Bartel, Carroll, Sabine, Shingler, White and Yacavone’s completion of the Arts Faculty Research
Leaders programme. McLelland’s completion of the University Research Leaders scheme in 2013
(Oergel currently enrolled) facilitated promotion and grant success. Research TRAINING EVENTS
include the Department’s Research Forum featuring Open Access presentations and University-level
CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION WORKSHOPS to support career advancement. Staff can
undertake the University’s Calibre bespoke career development programme for disabled staff. The
Department provides valuable career development to its Research Associates by including them in
Research Forums, Departmental Meetings and impact case study workshops.
Procedures to stimulate and facilitate exchanges with business/industry and third sector
bodies include University and School mechanisms. Kapcia received funding from the Nottingham
HERMES scholarships (£9.8k) to establish the Cuba Consultancy Unit for business collaborations.
The School’s staff development policy facilitated Davies’s five-year secondment to the Institute of
Modern Languages Research.

The unit supports and enables staff to achieve impact from their research through workload
planning and active participation in the Faculty’s impact funding, additional leave and buy-out
schemes. Centrally-allocated funding and the Arts Impact Accelerator Fund together provided £16k
for impact support (Bartel and Kapcia), including for an expert advisor and teaching buy-out, and the
Faculty Pro-Vice Chancellor’s Fund (see 3.2) sponsored an additional semester’s leave (Bartel).

MLC recognises and rewards staff for research and impact work by recommending salary
increments or bonuses, teaching buy-out, and promotion. Nine female and eight male R&T staff have
been promoted since 2014: Hirsekorn to Assistant Professor; Batchelor, Carroll, Frank, García,
Miranda, Sabine, Shingler, Stockey, White and Zoric to Associate Professor; Hitchcott, McLelland,
Oergel and Ridon to Professor (Lane and Roberts to Professor from August 2020). The 17
promotions (including one part-time colleague) are in line with the Department gender demographic
and betoken the effectiveness of MLC’s mentoring and support mechanisms.

                                                                                             Page 6
UNIT-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (REF5B)

Feedback from REF2014 highlighted the low number of PhD completions. Following the
implementation of new recruitment, monitoring and training policies centralised at School level,
doctoral degrees awarded are up 57%, to 54.3 FTE compared with 34.6 for REF2014. The
Department has had 47 new PGRs in the period and supports flexible pathways, including part-time
study (10 p/t students in the period).

MLC belongs to the AHRC Midlands4Cities (formerly, M3C) Doctoral Training Partnership, ranked
first in the 2018 round (IS, 3.3); Oergel is joint UoN site director and four staff contributed to panels.
Staff handling PGR recruitment have completed Unconscious Bias and interview training.

Recruitment strengths include: Lusophone Studies, with one new M3C/M4C PGR for five
consecutive years; Linguistics, with four (three M3C-funded) since 2016; Cuban Studies, with four.
Translation Studies, with 10, marks a new area of growth. Alongside an MRes, taught MAs in
translation have provided another route to M3C/M4C funding (three students). PGR studentships
include: 12 M3C/M4C plus 11 other AHRC; eight School; four Vice-Chancellor’s International and
three V-C’s EU scholarships; one US government; two Brazil CAPES-funded (co-supervised with
CMVS); one Portugal FCT-funded; one Nottingham French Studies-funded.

PROVISION AND SUPPORT FOR PGRS

Support for PGRs’ academic development and general wellbeing has been enhanced through the
appointment of a sole MLC Director of PG Studies (Ridon), improved shared training and monitoring
practices at School level, and a designated, experienced Faculty PG administrator responsible for
tracking and recording. All PGRs belong to the Researcher Academy, which ensures policy and
training are mapped to the Researcher Development Framework, the Research Council’s Statement
of Expectations for Postgraduate Training, and the QAA Quality Code (IS, 3.3).

All PGRs (including Part-time/Distance) are supported via supervision, annual review, core training
and skills development (including inter-institutional training (4.5)), publishing/presenting
opportunities, funding support, preparation for future careers, and teaching experience.

All PGRs have at least two supervisors, including a named lead, assigned according to expertise.
Full-time students receive a minimum of 10 supervisions annually; part-time a minimum of six.
Agreed written action points are lodged with the administrator. A more robust, School-wide annual
review process, which monitors progress and provides a channel for student feedback, is overseen
by the Director of PGR. Particularly important for first-year PhD candidates, the process involves
reviewers from outside the supervisory team and is a supportive means of airing doubts and offering
guidance. Supervisions contribute to monitoring wellbeing as well as intellectual progress, while a
dedicated School Postgraduate Student Advisor deals with serious pastoral matters such as
maternity leave arrangements, caring responsibilities, bereavement and severe ill-health, following
policies formulated in the University’s Quality Manual.

The unit offers extensive generic and tailored skills development training, including:
   • a School Research Skills module
   • a Faculty Research Methods module
   • core researcher training, including a mandatory research integrity element, by the
       Researcher Academy
   • regular Work-in-Progress seminars where all PGRs present their work annually to encourage
       peer-support and disciplinary cross-fertilisation
   • a Tradition of Critique lecture series run by Critical Theory
   • MLC Research Seminars

All students are invited to present at the annual Faculty PG Conference and the biennial MLC PG
Conference or, now in its 15 th year, the annual Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American Studies PG
Forum – all student-led. The Cuba Centre runs the annual PG workshop on Cuba, sharing practical
advice including for those working on Cuba elsewhere who lack resources or specialist supervision

                                                                                                  Page 7
UNIT-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (REF5B)
(10–15 people annually). Göttsche runs a peer-reviewed e-journal (four editions to date), based on
the Faculty-wide PG conference, edited by PGRs from UoN, Nottingham Trent and University of
Leicester. This affords PGRs training in research and conference organisation and professional
editing, and a publication platform for high-quality ECR research. PGRs have published more than
30 articles, in journals such as German Life and Letters (Thomas), Journal for French Language
Studies (Humphries), Stvdia Historica. Historia Contemporánea (Oviedo), Cadernos de Literatura
Comparada (Kirkby, Haysom), Identities: Global Studies in Culture and Power (Abadia), European
Journal of Higher Education (Mundt co-author), Humanities (Waller). Other striking PGR
achievements include Costa’s conference ‘100 Years of Sophia and Jorge de Sena’ (2019), Oviedo’s
co-edited Madrid, una ciudad en guerra (1936–1948), and Hellewell’s translation from Slovene of
None Like Her (Ni druge) by Jela Krečič-Žižek, completed while a PGR.

PGRs are supported by diverse funding (total £50.3k). Students may apply to the School PGR
Travel Prize Fund and the School Student Experience Fund (combined total awarded: £21.8k); the
Researcher Academy (£4.3k), and the Santander Mobility Fund, e.g. £1.1k to Montalva Armanet for
a Chile conference. M4C students may also apply to the Student Development and the Cohort
Development Funds (£24.2k since 2017). This support has enabled PGRs to conduct research or
present papers in 48 different locations, including Havana (Story), Kyoto (Martí Martínez), Chicago
(E. Kirk), St Petersburg (Miller), Bonn (Padden), Vancouver (Todd), Rio de Janeiro (Grossi), Taiwan
(Liu), New York (Taylor), Mexico City (Escobar) and Beijing (Li). PGRs secured an additional £16.6k
external funding: e.g. a German Academic Exchange Service scholarship for four months’ study in
Germany (Cotgrove, £5k).

Preparation for future careers includes the Centre for Advanced Studies’ Early Career Event open
to PGRs contemplating a career in academe. M4C students have access to an external partners’
scheme to enhance their transferable and employability skills (e.g. Harrison’s funded internship);
other PGRs to the Researcher Academy’s award-winning ‘Postgraduate Placement Programme’
(see IS, 3.3). To help recent PhD students secure a post or funding, the School operates a
POSTDOCTORAL BURSARY scheme: Oviedo and Hellewell were each awarded £9k (2020); Hellewell
publishing a translation, with a £500 award from English PEN, of Felix After the Rain (Srečkov
kovček) by Dunja Jogan during the fellowship, and Oviedo ‘Paz a mano armada. Los atracos y su
represión en el Madrid de la posguerra (1939–1944)’, in an edited volume, Morir en Madrid (1939–
1944) (2020). As preparation for academic careers, MLC offers TEACHING EXPERIENCE to PGRs,
subject to interview and teacher training offered through the Researcher Academy: 45 have taught
since 2014.

17 PGRs have progressed to lecturing or research posts (Smith, Pepe, Liu, Harrison, Story,
Thomas, Gardiner, Nicholls, Todd, Sun, Hu, Williamson, Rato Rodrigues, Gray, Vidal, Oviedo and
Kirk).

2.4 EQUALITY, DIVERSITY, AND INCLUSION

The Department has 33 research staff: 17 men, 16 women; one BAME colleague; 13 international;
none with a declared disability. 26 are full-time permanent, six 0.8 permanent, one 0.2 fixed-term. At
census date, eight were Professors (four men: four women), 15 Associate Professors (nine men: six
women) and 10 Assistant Professors (four men: seven women). Two are ECRs. A body of emeriti
enriches our research culture: e.g. Knight’s internationally recognised work on Roland Barthes
(edited volume); McGuirk’s video-interview project with war veterans.

Our commitment to an inclusive environment is shown by the diversity of our PGR community and
its own contributions to global issues of equality, diversity and inclusion. Of the 64 students (54.3
FTEs): 44 were women, 29 international, eight non-white, six gay or bisexual, six with a declared
disability. Students’ research includes: ‘The Normalisation of Sexual Diversity in Revolutionary Cuba’
(Kirk), Feminism and the University (Telling), ‘Representing Queer Women in German and British
Film and Television’ (Harper), plus projects on Rwandan women genocide survivors (Williamson,
Gilbert), animal welfare (Lazutkaite), indigenous schooling in Brazil (Ribeiro Meireles), and Pepe’s


                                                                                              Page 8

organisation of the ‘Re-gendering and (De)Queering Post-Conflict Societies’ conference (UoN
2013).

STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT AND PROMOTE EDI

The Department’s EDI strategy is underwritten by the University’s EDI Strategic Delivery Plan (IS,
3.5), the School’s Athena Swan action plan (Bronze award, 2018) and the School EDI Committee’s
priorities.

Workload planning is managed by HoD to ensure fairness and transparency. All full- and part-time
staff are entitled to study leave (total 69 semesters). Flexible and/or remote working is facilitated
by the requirement that staff need only be on campus for teaching, pastoral duties and meetings.
Career pathways for part-time and fixed-term staff are forged through annual appraisal
conversations, an annual research interview, career development workshops, research support from
the Centre for Advanced Studies, and equal eligibility for promotion and performance rewards. All
requests to reduce from full- to part-time have been approved. Fixed-term staff finishing their contract
may apply for Honorary Research Fellow status to maintain institutional affiliation. Emeriti have office
space, access to computing and other facilities; two continued paid co-supervision of PGRs, in line
with UoN policy. A Conference and Training Care Fund meets additional costs (principally,
childcare) associated with conference attendance (one colleague; COVID-cancelled). Maternity
leave is fully covered (e.g. one colleague by Scott), while two colleagues took a year’s unpaid
paternity leave. Staff on leave receive appropriate notifications (e.g. of research seminars of
interest). Support for colleagues returning from leave, managing long-term illness, or with caring
responsibilities includes paid Keeping in Touch days, where desired; phased return options (e.g. to
part-time in the first instance); timetabling blocks on certain hours/days; return-to-work meetings with
line manager, plus appropriate ongoing support (e.g. regular meetings, targeted mentoring). MLC
runs a writing group for women/non-binary staff, and Faculty a new parents group. For staff and
PGRs with disabilities, the UoN disability team works with individuals to ensure needs such as
access are met, general well-being monitored and any special equipment recommended by
Occupational Health purchased; supervisors regularly review the situation with the student. Support
for staff and PGR wellbeing is guided by University wellbeing and HR policies. PGRs experiencing
difficulties may interrupt their studies and extend their thesis-pending period.

Promotions applications explicitly invite disclosure of relevant personal circumstances and ask
about part-time status. Performance rewards are checked by Head of School, supported by HR,
for distribution by gender, part-time/full-time, career stage and protected characteristics compared
to the make-up of the staff body. Where colleagues’ or PGRs’ ability to undertake research has been
particularly affected by COVID-19, mentoring will be intensified, in some cases to fortnightly
meetings, and colleagues given the opportunity to describe the impact of COVID in all promotion,
study leave and internal funding applications, impact that will be taken into account explicitly in the
process. EDI representatives on Faculty and University promotions committees will ensure active
scrutiny of this and all other EDI aspects of applications.

EDI strategy and implementation are overseen by the School’s EDI Committee, chaired by the
Director of EDI, with key role-holders, including Directors of Research and KE, as ex officio members.
The committee oversees the Athena Swan action plan and ensures School operations consider
equality, diversity and inclusion in all their aspects. It reviews key data on staff and student
recruitment, staff progression, and research grant success, as well as Head of School’s proposed
research leadership portfolio allocations for gender balance. Actions are referred to other
departmental or school committees, including School Research Committee, where EDI is a standing
item. An EDI-related session features in School Away Days, and new policies now undergo Equality
Impact Assessments. A concrete change since 2014 is the moving of MLC Research Seminars to
family-friendly hours. All staff completed mandatory EDI training, while senior role-holders took
additional training (e.g. Stonewall Allies: McLelland, Hegarty).

CONSTRUCTION OF OUTPUTS PORTFOLIO


                                                                                                Page 9
UNIT-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (REF5B)
The outputs portfolio was constructed following the University’s Code of Practice (IS, 3.6). Individuals
were invited to declare personal circumstances; reviewers undertook Unconscious Bias training;
every output had two reviewers, using a proforma based on Guidance on Submissions; the REF
coordinator or a third reviewer resolved disagreements; female-authored outputs usually had at least
one female reviewer; a statistical analysis of the submission against all protected characteristics was
conducted, followed by appropriate re-reading. 53.8% of our submitted outputs are by men, 46.2%
by women (unit profile is 53.1% male, 46.9% female). Current Associate Professors contributed
42.3%, Professors 40.4%, and Assistant Professors 17.3% (unit profile is 46.9% Associates, 25%
Professors, 28.1% Assistants) – a distribution which reflects the 10 promotions from Assistant to
Associate.

 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities

3.1 EXTERNAL INCOME

Table 1
                           REF2014             REF2021
 External income           £1,551.5k           £1,818.5k (£1,716.1k HESA + £102.4k)
 External inc per FTE      £26,889             £58,285

Strategies and mechanisms to support the generation of research income include University, Faculty
and School seed funding, together with networking events, Research Centres, mentoring of grant
submissions, and regular study leave to lay the groundwork for successful grant applications (e.g.
Bartel, McLelland). This strategic investment increased the Department’s external research income
on REF2014, markedly so per FTE (up 117%), and enabled the unit to advance work in all five key
areas:

Literature (total £198.5k): Göttsche’s Leverhulme International Research Network award (£93.1k)
for ‘Landscapes of Realism: Rethinking Literary Realism(s) in Global Comparative Perspective’ (two
volumes due 2021); Oergel’s Leverhulme Research Fellowship for ‘Zeitgeist around 1800:
Containing Historical Complexity and Stimulating Cultural Activity’ (£40k: monograph); emeritus
Giles’s ‘Brecht into English’ (AHRC, £16.8k); and Bartel’s ‘Hungry for Words’ (AHRC, £31.5k) and
‘Consider Male Eating Disorders’ (AHRC, £17.1k), which returned a monograph and an impact case
study.

History, memory, and post-conflict (total £286.6k): comprising Hitchcott’s Rwandan genocide
project (Leverhulme Research Fellowship and AHRC Research Grant, combined £114.5k:
monograph); White’s Leverhulme Research Fellowship (£24k) for her monograph-project on the
relationship between Byzantium and Rus; Kapcia’s £68.9k (Leverhulme) for ‘Beyond Havana and
the Nation?’, with Kumaraswami (then Reading); McGuirk, with Miranda, Sharman, Stockey and
Lawrance, for ‘Memosur’ (EU Marie Curie, £56k: edited volume); Miranda’s British Council
Researcher Links Travel Grant (£3.8k) for ‘Transitions in Latin America’; ‘Ridon’s ‘Re-Enacting the
Silk Road’ (AHRC Network Grant CoI, £4.4k), and Leverhulme ‘Artist in Residence’ project (£15k).

Theory and intellectual history (total £99.7k): Johnson’s Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship
(£88.4k) for his seminal work on prehistoric technology; Lane’s BA/Leverhulme Small Grant (£2.5k)
for Republican Citizens, Precarious Subjects (monograph); and García’s ‘Gender and the Fantastic
in Hispanic Studies’ (BA, £8.8k), published as a Bulletin of Hispanic Studies special issue.
Audio-visual culture (total £72.5k): Yacavone’s BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grant (£8.4k),
Society for French Studies Prize Research Fellowship (£25.1k), and BA/Leverhulme Small Research
Grant (£5.5k) for her ‘Portrait of the Writer’ photography project; McMichael’s ‘Notes from the Zone
of Kaif’ (AHRC Fellowship, £32.2k); and Hegarty’s Small BA/Leverhulme grant (£1.3k; COVID-
affected £7.9k award) for ‘Francophonia: A Sonic Archaeology of French Cultures’.

Linguistics and translation (total £514.3k): McLelland’s ‘Towards a History of Modern Foreign
Language Teaching and Learning’ (AHRC network grant £12.3k; three-volume collection and two

                                                                                               Page 10
UNIT-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (REF5B)
special issues), ‘A History of Modern Language Education in the UK, 1600–2000’ (BA Mid-Career
Fellowship, £60k: monograph), ‘Using the History of Language Learning and Teaching to Engage
the Present and Improve the Future’ (AHRC Follow-on-Funding, £17.1k; cf. ICS3), ‘Multilingualism:
Empowering Individuals, Transforming Societies’ (AHRC, £279.3k), and Visiting Professorship for
Kibbee (Leverhulme, £22.6k). In Translation, Batchelor’s ‘Exploring 21 st-Century Sino-African
Dynamics’ (AHRC, £80.9k: edited volume), ‘Interlingual Translation and Healthcare Communication
in West Africa’ (Wellcome Prime Scholarship, £17k) and ‘Translating Frantz Fanon’ (£5.6k: edited
volume); and Mével’s ‘Integrated Immersive Inclusiveness’ and ‘Making Accessibility Accessible’
(AHRC, £19.5k).

Of the awards that constitute HESA external income, 39 principal grants were awarded to 21 different
recipients: 11 women, 10 men. Colleagues at all levels secured awards, evidence of effective
mentoring at all career stages: seven Professors, 17 Associate Professors, and seven Assistant
Professors. The unit’s strong record in nurturing ECR talent is also apparent in the eight postdoctoral
fellows or ECRs (totalling £543.6k) funded via three external schemes. Additional minor amounts of
external income totalled £1.7k.

HESA external income came mainly from traditional sources: Research Councils (50.6%), UK
Charities (41.6%), UK Government Bodies (4.7%), EU (3.1%). However, recent impact and KE work
in Health and Food (Bartel) and with museums and arts outlets (Roberts, Shingler, Hegarty,
McMichael), together with a recent successful EU postdoctoral fellowship (see 1.3), indicates
success in diversifying our income base to meet the shifting demands of the discipline and new
societal challenges. A Faculty review (2020) introduced a new Research and KE Strategy to
strengthen further mechanisms for generating diverse research investment in key areas.

The principal sources of non-HESA income (total £102.4k) include Banco de Santander (£40k), e.g.
£5k towards archival research for ‘African and Black Family History in Slavery and Freedom in Brazil
(Bahia 1830–1888)’ (Collins); the Partridge Bequest to Russian and Slavonic Studies (£17.5k), e.g.
£4k for the symposium ‘Was There Ever a Yugoslav Literature?’, Belgrade (Zoric, 2018); the Instituto
Camões for Post-Conflict Centre activities (£5.3k, see below); and Nottingham French Studies
(£39.6k) for a PhD studentship in French.

3.2. INTERNAL INCOME

Internal pump-priming investment totalling £161.4k has provided additional support for research,
impact and KE activities. All levels of staff have benefited, including postdoctoral fellows (e.g. £600
matched funding for Scott’s conference on French song). Internal support is available from diverse
Faculty, School, and University sources. The Faculty of Arts provided support for MLC research
totalling £90k. The Faculty Pro-Vice Chancellor’s Fund enables an additional semester’s leave for
research or impact activity, e.g. allowing Sharman to complete his Enlightenment monograph. The
fund has yielded three monographs and 25+ articles/chapters, as well as pump-priming new
initiatives, e.g. Bartel’s African Health Care project (4.3) and Sabine’s ‘Queer Portugal’. Eight
colleagues at all levels, from Assistant Professor (García, Sabine) to Associate Professor (Bartel,
Lane, Sharman, White; Miranda’s COVID-cancelled) and Professor (Göttsche) have benefited. The
Faculty has pump-primed other research activities (£17,104), such as the annual symposium of the
Comparative History of Literatures in European Languages Committee (Nottingham, May 2020; £2k
plus School’s £2.25k, COVID-postponed), and £20.1k to support research outputs and impact, e.g.
£1.4k and £1.9k for aspects of Bartel and Kapcia’s impact work, while the Arts Impact Accelerator
Fund furnished £12.5k, including £4.8k for an expert advisor and £4.1k for a Research Associate for
Bartel’s impact work; and £3.6k for ‘Pop-up World of Languages’ (see ICS3). MLC’s three Research
Centres (3.3 below) each received School funding (total £49k, COVID-affected) to support their
activities, which delivered 15 conferences and 50+ outputs. The Interdisciplinary Research Clusters
were likewise supported by internal funding: Languages, Texts and Society (£12.1k), e.g. for
‘Memory and Postcolonial Studies’ conference (edited volume); and Digital and Creative, for projects
with New Art Exchange (£3k) and Nottingham Contemporary (£1.2k; Hegarty, COVID-delayed). The
School Research Committee provides funds for conference travel and organisation, fieldwork,
outputs and impact-related activities (total £80,652), e.g. £3.5k towards monograph image rights

                                                                                              Page 11
UNIT-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (REF5B)
(Andrews) and £1.6k to present an overseas conference paper ‘Social Meaning, Style, and
Language Variation in Beijing’ (postdoctoral fellow Zhao). Besides these sources, MLC colleagues
have also accessed the University International Collaboration Fund (£8.3K; IS, 4.1c) to build new
collaborations with Bonn and Halle (Oergel), and Toronto (Frank); and a Wellcome Prime
Scholarship to explore ‘The Role of GPs in Diagnosis and Treatment of Male EDs’ (Bartel, £6k).

3.3 INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITIES

UoN’s infrastructure, internal investment and commitment to interdisciplinarity (IS, 2.1a) underpin
the vitality and sustainability of MLC research and impact. Following REF2014, MLC had significant
leadership input into one of the University-level Interdisciplinary Research Clusters (IRCs), created
to produce a step-change in scholarly infrastructure for interdisciplinary and collaborative research
and KE/impact work. The Languages, Texts and Society IRC facilitated work by seven colleagues,
and conference and publication opportunities for 26 PGRs at and beyond UoN. MLC co-leads
Creative and Digital, a new Interdisciplinary Research Cluster. Bartel participates in the Improving
Health and Wellbeing IRC, leading to her appointment as PI for the South Africa project (GCRF,
£10K). The Department’s three Research Centres provide vital additional scholarly infrastructure.
The Cuba Centre organised six annual conferences (three each Havana and UK), involving 300
delegates; the Post-Conflict Centre ran seven conferences; the Centre for Translation and
Comparative Cultural Studies hosted two conferences on translation software. The Department also
benefited from the Nottingham Research Fellowships scheme (Whitt) and the major resource of
UoN’s two international campuses: notably, Sabine and Miranda’s conference, 'The Indian Ocean:
Terrains of Meaning and Materiality’, in Malaysia (40 delegates); and McLelland’s 2017 conference
in China (output: 2021).

Administrative infrastructure is led by the Research and Innovation team and the Researcher
Academy. The Faculty’s Centre for Advanced Studies provides Arts-based training, bid-writing
workshops, and practical support with finances, and ensures all applications are mentored and peer
reviewed before submission. Headed by Bowden, its research support staff contribute to School
Away Days, REF planning, and School Research Committee. Impact support has been significantly
enhanced by a full-time Faculty Impact Support Officer (Walas), who coordinates impact across the
Faculty and sits on the Faculty Research and KE Committee, and by a dedicated Research
Associate (Vytniorgu). Both work closely with MLC’s Marks, who is the School Knowledge Exchange
and Impact Officer, chairs the School Impact and Knowledge Exchange Sub-committee, and sits on
School Research Committee. The Midlands3Cities/M4C Doctoral Training Partnership has also
benefited staff and PGRs (see 2.3) through funding and infrastructure for collaborations and research
training.

Improved physical infrastructure and facilities, along with the expertise of support staff, has
benefited research and impact activities. Mével used the new Monica Partridge Building (named
after the University’s first woman professor, a Modern Linguist) for technical rehearsals for the
Hackfest performance, and the Mixed Reality Lab and its support staff in Computer Science for the
immersive technologies project. Equipment from the Video team also produced a video trailer
(Mével), while university studio filming facilities enable follow-on funding impact (McLelland). To
secure the impact legacy of the scholarship subtending ICS3, UoN library has established a
Language Learning Textbooks collection as part of its Special Collections. Central to the impact
underpinning ICS1 is the unique Hennessy Collection, an archive of newspapers and books from
Cuba not normally easily available in the UK, which has also yielded seven PhD theses since 2014
and drawn one international doctoral researcher (Spain) and two postdoctoral visitors (Australia and
Spain). The University’s Djanogly Theatre produced two Zarzuela performances (director: Andrews).
Its Digital Transformations Hub runs workshops for research staff and students using the Gale Digital
Scholar Lab, and Digital Media sessions with support from the Video Production team to help create
digital content. The University’s Trent Building housed ‘Barbed World’, a public photographic
exhibition (2016) by PGRs Grossi and Martí Martínez, part-funded by the School’s Centre for
Research in Race and Rights, of around 80 pictures from global locations including Brazil, Cuba,
Czech Republic, Italy and the USA.


                                                                                            Page 12
UNIT-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (REF5B)
Staff have their own offices, postdoctoral fellows share offices, and PGRs hot-desk. Staff and fellows
have UK standard digital and IT resources while PGRs access workstations in a shared PG space
(50 desks for ca. 80 School PGs). In September 2013 the postgraduate accommodation was moved
to be near the School’s administrative hub and supervisors’ offices. All staff, postdoctoral fellows and
PGRs have equal unlimited use of print facilities.

 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society

The Department has collaborated with HEIs from 30+ countries and with diverse academic and non-
academic, national and international partners, research users and communities.

4.1 ARRANGEMENTS AND SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS, NETWORKS AND PARTNERSHIPS

Underpinned by the University’s IRCs and the Department’s Research Centres, arrangements to
support collaborations range from workload planning, e.g. teaching cover for Bartel’s impact work,
to travel grants, funding for visitors and pump-priming for KE workshops. Interdisciplinary UoN
collaborations are outlined in 4.4. Meanwhile, major funding body sponsorship, our Research
Centres, and UoN’s overseas campuses provided support for international collaborations. These
included: Göttsche’s Leverhulme network of 50 scholars from 18 countries; and ‘Memosur – A
Lesson for Europe: Memory, Trauma and Reconciliation in Chile and Argentina’, led at UoN by the
Post-Conflict Centre, with 26 members at all levels from four countries. ‘Memosur’ led to Miranda’s
inclusion in the Portuguese-funded project ‘Women, Arts and Dictatorship’ and the Spanish-funded
project ‘Literature, Rhetoric, Discourse’, and to Stockey’s as a consultant at the Madrid workshop of
MEMORYLAB (2017), an international network of memory and human rights scholars/practitioners.
Colleagues collaborated with three UK universities and Girona in the AHRC-funded ‘MEITS’ project;
with Brazil, Mexico, Bangladesh, Slovenia, Senegal and Jamaica in the AHRC ‘Poverty Research
Network’ (Collins); and with Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University (see 4.3). Further
collaborations included the International AHRC network ‘Culture and its Uses as Testimony’
(Hirsekorn); ‘Saints at War’ (Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim) and the
AHRC network ‘Defining the Global Middle Ages’ (White); ‘Zeitgeist’, with Bonn and Halle (Oergel);
and the Canadian Research Council-funded ‘The Final Chapter of Russia Abroad’, with Toronto
(Frank).

4.2 RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY RESEARCH USERS, BENEFICIARIES AND AUDIENCES TO DEVELOP IMPACT

Across all staff levels, MLC deepened long-standing relationships, and established new ones, to
develop impact beyond academia. The Post-Conflict Centre’s work since 2006 with war veterans
from both sides of the Falklands-Malvinas conflict has profoundly enriched our research
environment, leading to the publication of veterans’ testimonies and to engagement with
governments, politicians and diplomats, e.g. the 'Trauma and Memory: Europe and Latin
America' conference at the Argentine Embassy, with eight Latin American ambassadors (2015).
Following their involvement in two Spanish archaeological projects to discover Lorca’s and other
victims’ remains, Roberts and Stockey hosted the first conference (2017; 50 attendees, including
archaeologists and journalists) to assemble representatives from Spain’s major political parties to
debate historical memory policy. The Cuba Centre continued its internationally known work
promoting academic and public knowledge of Cuba, with Foreign and Commonwealth Office
consultations, ambassadorial briefings, and a report for a foreign government (ICS1). MLC received
£181,228 European Regional Development Funds from a £23m institution-wide initiative (‘Enabling
Innovation’) working with SMEs; McLelland secured £8.2k ESRC Impact Accelerator funding (2019)
for a postdoctoral fellow-authored report evaluating business language needs against local language
skills. Bartel’s relationship with healthcare bodies and charities helped double Britain’s second
largest eating disorders charity’s income (ICS2), while Mével worked with D/deaf audiences
designing a video offering accessible paratext with integrated captions (500 views). We developed
partnerships with the cultural sector to expand and diversify the region’s cultural offer and creative
economy (IS, 2.2d). Highlights include the Granada Book Fair round table (c. 120 people) to
celebrate the UNESCO City of Literature partnership between Granada and Nottingham (the first-

                                                                                               Page 13
UNIT-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATE (REF5B)
ever ‘invited city’), part-initiated by Roberts. Irish RTÉ Radio 1 interviewed Roberts about his Lorca
biography, reviewed in two Irish newspapers. Part of Zoric’s The Rhetoric of Exile was broadcast on
Radio Belgrade (2018). Stockey gave interviews to Gibraltar media outlets, principally on Brexit.
Mével co-authored a creative captions article for The Stage (2019). Hegarty collaborated with
musician Romain Perrot, curated the Deliquium music festival (London, 2018: 300 attendees), and
recruited members from five cultural sector organisations to the Creative and Digital board.
McLelland’s work on multilingualism was used directly by schools and colleges (see below).

4.3 ENGAGEMENT WITH DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND PUBLICS

We have been fortunate to engage with diverse communities. A mix of male and female staff (five
Assistant Professors, three Associates and two Professors) were involved in 22 public talks, six
exhibitions, two operettas, two videos and a film series. Locally, Collins spoke on African slave
families in Brazil at Nottingham Art Exchange as part of Black History Month, and Sabine gave a
lecture-recital, ‘To Walt with Love’, aimed at the LGBT community, at the AHRC ‘Being Human’
Festival, Nottingham Contemporary gallery. Mével’s performances for D/deaf community
audiences showed at 13 venues (18 performances, 2000 people) locally and nationally, while Bartel
engaged with healthcare professionals (the Royal College of GPs recommends her clinical training
tool to 50,000+ members) and schoolchildren from seven East Midlands secondary schools, and
McLelland with 600 pupils from 13 schools, plus 2,500 members of the public, through the ‘Pop-Up
World of Languages’, Nottingham City Library. Hegarty engaged with cultural event publics at four
events at Nottingham Contemporary, while Andrews staged two concerts for Nottingham Lakeside
Arts (audience: 65), Roberts spoke on Lorca at Five Leaves Bookshop, Nottingham, and Palfreyman
and Marks at Nottingham’s Broadway Cinema. Broadway and the Kino Klassika Foundation, London
jointly screened a Soviet/Russian music films season curated by McMichael (300 attendees).

Further national engagement included PGR Resinente’s work on access to HIV services among
Brazilian expats, especially sex workers, in London, but was principally with cultural event publics,
including talks at the Margarethe von Trotta retrospective, Sheffield Showroom (Palfreyman);
Richmond-Scott’s production of Blood Wedding, Omnibus Theatre, London (Roberts); and ‘Boulez
at 90 Festival’, Barbican (Shingler). Exhibitions included: ‘Aurel Stein and the Silk Road’, the Royal
Geographical Society (Ridon with Heffernan), and ‘Figures with Absent Landscape’, UoN (Frédéric
Lecloux, with Ridon); audio commentary for Tate Modern’s Sonia Delaunay exhibition (Shingler);
and work with Café Oto, London, and Milik and Lead Galleries, including supporting their successful
bid for charity status (Hegarty). Extending her Women in Latin American Independence project,
Davies (with Thomas) engaged with the London Latin American female diaspora in the exhibition,
‘Empowerment through Art: Photography and Latin American Migrant Girls’, Institute of the
Americas, London.

Internationally, Bartel worked with 25 South-African women survivors of sexual violence in
townships, 16 students and 24 staff from Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, while PGR
Kirk worked with sexual healthcare professionals in Cuba. Roberts was the first foreign academic to
curate an exhibition at the Carlism Museum, Estella, Spain, ‘El Carlismo en la novela española
finisecular’ (Oct 2019–June 2020), involving six talks/training sessions to pupils and teachers (150
people). The exhibition (YouTube video: 446 views) led to 120 Navarran pupils studying Carlism.

4.4 CONTRIBUTION TO THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE DISCIPLINE, SUPPORT FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY
RESEARCH, AND RESPONSIVENESS TO NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PRIORITIES AND INITIATIVES

One of the Department’s principal contributions to the sustainability of the discipline, and evidence
of its responsiveness to national and international priorities and initiatives, is its leadership of
professional associations and learned societies. The major French and German subject
associations had Nottingham leadership (Still, President of the Society for French Studies;
McLelland, Vice-President of the Association for German Studies). Still prioritised improving ECR
funding and representation in the Society and addressed ECR support at the University Council of
Modern Languages. Colleagues have also served as: executive member of the British Comparative

The unit’s support for interdisciplinary research was driven by IRCs, Research Centres, research
networks, and individual initiatives. In addition to the international collaborations described in 4.1,
UK/UoN interdisciplinary projects include McMichael’s on Soviet Russian rock music cultures with
historian Fürst (Bristol; AHRC); Ridon’s Travel Culture Network with Business and Geography (13
speakers, two exhibitions, one monograph); and Carroll’s Theory and Modernity research group with
Cultural, Media and Visual Studies (two symposia, with invited external speakers and homegrown
PGRs). Further work includes Languages, Texts and Society’s ten interdisciplinary events, notably
Shingler’s ‘Modernist Art Writing’ conference with English and Art History; Bartel’s with five UoN
Schools in the Improving Health and Wellbeing IRC; Hegarty’s with English and Cultural, Media and
Visual Studies in the Creative and Digital IRC; Mével with English and Computing (4.3); and Andrews
with Music (two operettas).

4.5 INDICATORS OF WIDER INFLUENCE, CONTRIBUTIONS TO AND RECOGNITION BY THE RESEARCH BASE

An important contribution to the research base is the journal editorship of Nottingham French
Studies (editor: Shingler), a major peer-reviewed journal, with frequent special issues, published by
Edinburgh UP; all French staff sit on the board. We have been editors of three other major journals
(Language & History, McLelland; Comparative Critical Studies, Oergel; and Journal of Romance
Studies, Davies), and of eight special journal issues, including Modern and Contemporary France
and Bulletin of Hispanic Studies. Kapcia was Book Series Editor for Bulletin of Latin American
Research.

Editorial board membership: Colleagues have served on 30 journal boards from 10 countries.
Service includes ECRs (Walsh: Language & History) and other Assistant Professors (Mertens: Dutch
Crossing, Vidal Bouzon: Boletim da Academia Galega da Lingua Portuguesa, Yacavone: Barthes
Studies). We sit on the advisory boards of five national and international journals, including
Paragraph (Still) and Hispanistica XX (Roberts). Göttsche was re-elected member of the
International Comparative Literature Association’s Committee overseeing the book series
Comparative History of Literatures in European Languages; Kapcia sat on the boards of University
Press of Florida and Lexington Books; and Davies, on those of University of Wales Press and
Legenda. Hegarty edits Bloomsbury’s ‘ex:centrics’ series and McLelland is on the editorial board for
Amsterdam UP’s Languages and Culture in History, while Davies has been Series Editor for MUP’s
Hispanic Texts since 2001.

Membership of national and international Research Councils and participation on grants
committees: MLC staff have served on seven national and nine international research councils or
grant-awarding bodies, including the British Academy (Still, Kumaraswami, Kapcia), Leverhulme
(Kumaraswami, Kapcia), the AHRC Peer Review College (seven colleagues), AHRC Strategic
Review panels (Göttsche and McLelland, three panels, plus a Strategic Peer Review panel for the
DTP2 scheme). Internationally, Still belongs to the peer review college of the European Science
Foundation, and Sabine to the advisory board of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research
Council of Canada. Other colleagues have assessed for multiple councils in Ireland, Poland, Estonia,
Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Holland, and Spain.

Invited keynotes, lectures and/or performances, or conference chair role: Colleagues delivered
360 conference papers at 17 UK and 33+ international institutions, notably Collins’s invited paper at
the Sixth Annual Global Brazil Conference, Duke University (2020). We gave 32 keynote addresses,
including Kapcia’s at the Association for Iberian and Latin American Studies for Australasia (2018),
Palfreyman’s at the Family Sagas conference (2017) and McLelland’s at the International
Conference of the History of Linguistic Sciences (Paris 2017). White was invited to give the Summer
Lecture for the Society for the Promotion of Byzantine Studies (COVID-cancelled).

Co-operation and collaborative arrangements for PGR and postdoctoral fellows: The unit
collaborated with five universities in the Midlands4Cities DTP and offered PGR training at the
Institute for Modern Languages Research. International collaborations include supervising nine
visiting PGRs: from Madrid (x2), Cordoba (Argentina), FU Berlin, Münster, Gießen, Wuppertal,
Higher School of Economics, Moscow and University of Iceland. We held 25 PG External
examinerships nationally and 21 internationally (including Paris 8, Monash, Oulu, Madrid, Bergen,
Venice and Münster).

Research fellowships and other awards, honours and esteem indicators: In addition to the
above indicators, the Department’s standing within the discipline has been further recognised at all
staff levels. Kapcia won two UoN Impact Prizes (2017, 2018; IS, 2.2a), and Bartel UoN best Health
Humanities contribution award (2019). Nationally, Yacavone won the Society for French Studies
