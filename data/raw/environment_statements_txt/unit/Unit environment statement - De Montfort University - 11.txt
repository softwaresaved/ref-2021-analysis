 1.1 UNIT CONTEXT AND STRUCTURE
 The UOA 11 research submission is coincident with the School of Computer Science and
 Informatics (SCSI), one of three Schools within the Faculty of Computing, Engineering and
 Media (FCEM). Combining internationally recognised expertise with the latest technology, SCSI
 develops cutting-edge research-based solutions to real-world scientific problems. In comparison
 to RAE 2008, our REF 2014 4*/3*research increased 12 points to 57% while our 1* research
 decreased 12 points to 3%.
 To help advance both the depth and breadth of our research, in line with FCEM and DMU policy,
 the Unit set out a more formal and focused structure for research groupings in three intertwined
 research institutes (Figure 1) to enhance leadership through mentoring, to enhance performance
 management through goal-setting and -monitoring and to stimulate interdisciplinary research
 and the collaborative supervision of research students. Much of our research is focused on
 distinctive niches, a characteristic that we wish to maintain. Thus, our current research structure
 maps better our rich, long-established and world-leading three areas of research: Artificial
 Intelligence, Cyber Security, and Ethics of Information and Communications Technology (ICT).

 1.1.1 The Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility (CCSR)
 CCSR aims to develop the practical and theoretical direction of research in ethical and social
 aspects of emerging technologies; responsible research and innovation; computer and
 information ethics; and ethics and culture of robots and Artificial Intelligence (AI). CCSR has
 gained an enviable international reputation as an international leader in research into the ethical
 and social implications of ICT: providing policy advice to the European Commission; leading
 events based in the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee
 and UK Parliament; spin-off company ORBIT (jointly owned by DMU and the University of
 Oxford), as a result of an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)
 contract, to provide training to EPSRC Centres for Doctoral Trainings (CDTs) across the EPSRC

 portfolio; the work of its new interest research group Women Ethics Robotics and Artificial
 Intelligence (WE R AI) into sex robots is now part of the campaigning policies of national and
 international Women’s Rights Groups (US: Prostitution Education and Research; Australia:
 Collective Shout; UK: FiLia, Campaign to End All Sexual Exploitation; France: RadicalGirlsss);
 while its research on ethics and professionalism in the computing field underpinned the 2016–
 2018 rewrite of the original 1992 Code of Ethics of the Association of Computing Machinery
 (ACM).
 1.1.2 The Cyber Technology Institute (CTI)
 CTI focuses on the development of knowledge and technologies to ensure a smart, safe and
 secure cyberspace. In June 2019 the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the EPSRC
 recognised CTI as an ‘Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research’ (ACE-CSR),
 the first in the East Midlands and one of only two in post-1992 universities. CTI’s work is
 supported by an Industrial Advisory Group comprising Airbus, BT, Deloitte UK and Rolls-Royce,
 whose regular feedback on research ensures that the CTI remains focused on providing
 relevant solutions that meet industry’s needs. CTI is a member of two national research
 institutes, the Research Institute in Science of Cyber Security (RISCS) and Research Institute in
 Trustworthy Inter-connected Cyber-physical Systems (RITICS), and an Airbus Centre of
 Excellence in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition. The CTI brings together the expertise of
 three specialist research centres:
 •   The Cyber Security Centre is a multidisciplinary group of academics and industry experts
     who focus on a variety of topics in cybersecurity, including Industrial Control Systems, data
     privacy, cyber intelligence, cybercrime and malware.
 •   The Software Technology Research Laboratory focuses on the study, analysis and
     advancement of the specification, design and engineering of computing systems.
 •   The Context Intelligence and Interaction Research Group focuses on building and analysing
     complex smart systems, comprising: sensing devices; interacting agents, including people
     and other organisms; embedded systems; and robots and autonomous software agents
     within open, pervasive environments.
 1.1.3 The Institute of Artificial Intelligence (IAI)
 IAI provides world leading-edge interdisciplinary research on artificial intelligence and data
 analytics, with strong contributions from fields such as Mathematics, Decision Sciences and
 Operational Research. It focuses more specifically on two areas: computational intelligence and
 intelligent transportation systems.
 •   The Centre for Computational Intelligence develops computational intelligence paradigms–
     based research solutions to real-world decision-making and prediction problems. Our high-
     quality, industrially relevant research into theoretical foundations and real-world applications
     of intelligent systems has four main areas of focus:
        o   Evolutionary computation – evolutionary algorithms, including genetic algorithms,
            swarm intelligence and memetic computing.
        o   Fuzzy logic – uncertainty models, including fuzzy sets, rough sets and grey systems.
        o   Intelligent Data Analysis – development of innovative methods and intelligent
            systems for integrating and analysing a variety of real-world data and data streams;
            supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches and tools in natural
            language processing (semantic analysis); Market Basket Analysis.
        o   Intelligent mobile robots, computer vision and games – expanding the robotics
            portfolio and integrating AI methods with games.
 •   The DMU Interdisciplinary Group in Intelligent Transport Systems is dedicated to
     researching and developing programmes that progress the introduction of sustainable urban
     and regional transport policies across Europe and beyond.

                                                                                                Page 2

 1.2 RESEARCH STRATEGY
 Our research strategy rests on the following research principles:
 •   Creating and applying knowledge: Our Unit researchers engage, when possible, on cross-
     university (University of Oxford, Loughborough University, Imperial College among others;
     and many European HE institutions; see section 3), cross-faculty (Innovation Fellowship with
     the School of Pharmacy) and cross-disciplinary projects and teams (Intelligent Cyber
     Security between IAI and CTI), but also recognise that successful research can proceed
     both from the activity of research groups as well as individual scholars, depending on
     discipline norms. In all cases, our researchers have a primary affiliation with one of our three
     School research institutes which, based on plans and performance, are provided with
     financial incentives from our Faculty to give a degree of autonomy to researchers to
     maximise the inputs to and outputs from their research.
 •   Inclusion and diversity research culture: We are committed to address diversity-related gaps
     wherever they manifest in our Unit. Staff with decision-making capacity have undergone
     Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) training along the lines promoted by Advance HE. We
     have actively worked during the present census to improve gender and Black or minority
     ethnic (BAME) balance in research (significant increases of both female and BAME staff
     researchers submitted in this REF compared to REF 2014; see 2.3).
 •   Research ethics and research integrity: Our researchers are aware of their social
     responsibilities, including those arising from research ethics and research integrity. This
     applies to all aspects of the research process. UOA 11 is at the forefront of practical and
     theoretical direction of research in computer ethics and responsible innovation in ICT: we
     were the only executive committee member from outside the US in the 2016–2018 rewrite of
     the original 1992 Code of Ethics of the ACM. This research was done in conjunction with
     leading computer ethics and industry experts in the USA and ACM members around the
     world.
 •   Open Access and Research Data Management: The SCSI, as well as DMU, recognises the
     need for researchers to protect their own research interests in the process of planning their
     research and obtaining their results. Nevertheless, the School encourages researchers to be
     as open as possible in disseminating their work. Researchers are aware of the Policy for
     Managing Open Access at DMU and the Research Data Management Policy, as well as the
     Institutional Publications Fund linked to the University’s ‘Policy on Incentivising Staff to
     Engage in Research and Innovation Activity’ to support the costs of Gold Open Access. Our
     research publications are made available through the Green Open Access route via the
     DMU Open Research Archive (DORA) publications repository and since April 2019 our
     researchers and postgraduate research (PGR) students can use our new, secure and user-
     friendly cloud-based Research Data Management repository, DMU Figshare, to make our
     research data openly accessible to the wider research community both nationally and
     internationally.
 •   Undertake ambitious, innovative and rigorous research with impact on the wider society: We
     particularly encourage and facilitate work with international, national and regional
     communities to disseminate the results from our research to the wider public and to increase
     awareness of the effect and benefit our research has in the quality of life of society in
     general, as reported in our five research impact case studies (see 1.3).
 1.2.1 Review of research strategy
 Over the present REF 2021 census period, we retained and developed further those research
 strategies that proved successful in REF 2014, while seeking to evolve, advance and support
 our existing research themes to increase and strengthen the amount of top-rated research in
 REF 2021. Key areas of development and progress against plans highlighted in REF 2014:
 •   Evolving and advancing our existing research themes. Progress: formation of research
     institutes within UOA 11, continued commitment to interdisciplinary research into the
                                                                                               Page 3
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

     responsible use of technology, as evidenced by the creation of the interdisciplinary Special
     Interest Group WE R AI (as described in 1.1).
 •   Developing the Unit’s research capability by recruiting high-quality researchers at every
     stage of their career. Progress: VC2020 recruitment and appointments (2.1).
 •   Proactively supporting and mentoring staff in their research activities, with a specific
     mentoring scheme in place to support early career researchers (ECRs), improve succession
     planning and provide a better culture for PGR students. Progress: provided and facilitated
     professional development sessions for both research staff at all stages of their careers and
     research students: Future Research Leaders’ Programme, Doctoral College PhD
     Scholarships Scheme, and Next Generation Researchers’ Programme for emerging
     independent researchers (section 2).
 • Increasing the research profile of the Unit both nationally and internationally. Progress:
     Increased the Unit’s research performance and standing in world and UK rankings
     (described in 1.2.2); hosted international research leaders and international conferences
     (section 4).
 •   Maintaining a dynamic multi- and interdisciplinary research environment where staff
     undertake ambitious, innovative and rigorous research with impact on the wider society
     Progress: significant investment in research (3.2) that includes ‘pathways to impact’ (1.3);
     improvement of our web presence; public engagement activities via new University initiatives
     (DMUlocal, DMUglobal; Health, Smart cities; data analytics with Leicester City Council).
 1.2.2 REF 2021 research strategy analysis
 Our REF 2021 census period research strategy has led to the increases (below) in research
 productivity, dissemination to the research community, international research collaboration,
 research influence, and funding in the current REF census period with respect to the previous
 REF census period (Key Performance Indicators in parentheses):

 Research productivity (number and type of research outputs)
 During this census period we aimed at increasing both the quantity and percentage of our
 research outputs published in international journals (article type). Using Web of Science (WoS)
 data on InCites UK REF 2021 Research Area 11, Computer Science and Informatics, Table 1
 shows that we published 33% more research outputs in the six-year census period [2014–2019]
 of REF 2021 than in the six-year census period [2008–2013] of REF 2014, while the proportion
 of article type documents published increased from 36% in REF 2014 to 54% in REF 2021.

     REF 2014 [2008–2013]     466                             36% (168)        60% (279)
     REF 2021 [2014–2019]     621 (+33% wrt REF 2014)         54% (338)        40% (249)

 Dissemination to the research community (proportion of research outputs in top quartile of
 journals with impact factor – Q1 JIF)
 Peer-reviewed journal outputs are widely available to the scientific community. Therefore, they
 have the potential of being read/used by other researchers and ultimately lead to an increase of
 our academic impact and our standing in world universities rankings (see corresponding
 heading below). Table 2 indicates that our REF 2021 publications in JIF journals and the
 proportion of them published in the top Q1 based on citations increased significantly with
 respect to REF 2014.


                                                                                                Page 4

 Internationalisation (percentage of international collaborations – IC)
 We aimed during this census period to increase our international outlook. UOA 11 facilitated the
 research visits of our staff to international research centres as well as visits to us by international
 staff. This has translated into significant increases of our proportion of research with
 international co-authors in REF 2021 against REF 2014 (Table 3).
 Table 3: UOA 11 international collaboration (InCites updated 29 January 2020; WoS

 Research influence (citation impact – category normalised citations index – CNCI)
 Our IC increase also translated to a significant increase in research influence as measured by
 the CNCI (Table 4): a value of 1 represents performance at par with world average and values
 above one are considered above average.

     REF 2021 [2014–2019]            2.28 (+90% wrt REF 2014)          2.78 (+84% wrt REF 2014)

 Funding (percentage increase in REF 2021 against REF 2014)
 During this census period, we also aimed to increase our external research funding from the
 levels we achieved in the REF 2014 period, which was 28% higher than in RAE 2008. The Unit
 increased its external research funding from £3,050,000, reported for the REF 2014 five-year
 period 2008–2012, to £8,880,000, for REF 2021’s six-year period 2013–2019. This means the
 Unit’s current REF period external research income incremented by 302%, which translates into
 an annual average increase of 243% in external research funding achieved by the Unit during
 the current REF with respect to the REF 2014 period.
 The combined increase in our research productivity, research influence and international
 research collaboration translated into DMU UOA 11 being listed during the current REF period
 as a world top University in Computer Science in both the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World
 Universities (ARWU) (2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 – WoS) and the Times Higher Education
 World University Rankings (THE WUR; 2019, 2020 – Scopus).
 •   THE WUR 2020 listed 749 world universities, 54 of which are UK HEIs. DMU UOA 11
     achieved a world top 201–250, placing us 24th of 54 in the UK.
 •   The 2020 Shanghai ARWU for listed 500 world CS universities, of which 39 were UK HEIs.
     DMU UOA 11 achieved a world top 151–200 and 13th of 39 in the UK, with our research
     placed world joint first based on the CNCI criterion and 32nd (5th in the UK) based on the IC
     criterion.
                                                                                                 Page 5

 1.2.3 Our research strategy for the next five years
 Our Unit research strategy for the next five years aims to:
 • strengthen existing areas of excellence through investment in people, infrastructure, and
    impact activity;
 • push the boundary of technology/AI and the human, as a distinctive feature of the Unit;
 • identify and nurture new and emerging areas of excellence and research clusters;
 • develop strategic partnerships with external organisations to increase the impact of our
    research; and
 • work with the Research Services Directorate (RSD) to improve research capacity among
    existing staff and the quality and success rate of external grant funding applications.

 1.3 IMPACT STRATEGY
 The School works to actively identify and seek key local, national and international organisations
 that can benefit from our research. We have an Industrial Liaison Committee dedicated to
 creating and strengthening mutually beneficial relationships between the School and
 corporations worldwide, by providing advice and support to help increase levels of engagement
 in collaborative research and development activities. The majority of our research goes hand-in-
 hand with stakeholder collaboration, with many of our projects being undertaken in direct
 partnership with industry, or with the aim of improving and adding to industrial technology and
 practice through subsequent consultancy and knowledge exchange.
 The Unit’s approach to impact during the census period has been to encourage work in areas
 that demonstrate potential impact and sustainability. To achieve this, significant investment in
 staff and physical resources has been made available by a broad range of highly selective
 competitive mechanisms (research scholarships, research leave, pump-priming research and
 innovation funding) that include ‘pathways to impact’ as one of the assessment criteria
 (section 3).
 Annual events dedicated to the promotion of Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs), our
 Technology Showcase and external events where we participate, like the Leicester Business
 Festival, provide businesses and organisations with the opportunity to explore and experience a
 range of cutting-edge technologies in computing, information science, sustainability and the
 creative fields. Our Technology Showcase has been delivering expert information and
 partnership opportunities to businesses since 2004 and has been responsible for a number of
 successful collaborations. Part-time industry-funded PhDs, especially in the CTI, provide a direct
 route for embedding research findings in real-world organisations. During the REF 2021 period,
 seven students have completed their PhDs in this way. Three of our five impact case studies
 result from these types of collaborations, with businesses and organisations:
 •   ‘Cyber Incident Response and Risk in Industrial Control Systems’: We have developed new
     methodologies for improved understanding and responding to threats and vulnerabilities
     within Industrial Control Systems. The methods have been adopted by users such as the UK
     and NATO military partners, changing their Cyber Risk and Threat Intelligence procedures.
     The work has led to DMU being (1) recognised as an Academic Centre of Excellence in
     Cyber Security Research by the National Cyber Security Centre, one of only two Academic
     Centres of Excellence in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition cybersecurity in Europe
     by Airbus, and (2) admitted to RITICS, funded by EPSRC/NCSC.
 •   ‘Evaluating Human Error–Related Information Security’: CTI researchers have created the
     novel Information Security Core Human Error Causes (IS-CHEC) technique, which is an
     adaptation of the Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART). The IS-
     CHEC tool aims to capture and analyse root causes of human errors in information security
     incident analysis. We are able to map information security incidents to HEART Generic Task
     Types (GTT) and Error Producing Conditions (EPC), which has been applied in both public
     sector (healthcare services provider) and private sector (IT security service provider). Our
     real-time 12 month (2018–2019) action research cycle within both public and private sector
                                                                                               Page 6
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

     organisations in parallel have positively impacted the involved organisations in terms of
     reducing and preventing human error–related information security incidents.
 •   ‘Support for Operations and Security for the Global Air Transport Industry: Modelling,
     Forecasting and Optimisation’: Applicability of our Computational Intelligence algorithms has
     led to major impact in the management of processes and operations, especially in the air
     transport industry. The research led by Gongora resulted in a spin-off company, as well as
     the participation of the lead academic in international advisory activities. Gongora has
     actively participated in the development of the Smart Security programme Guidelines
     disseminated to all the airports around the world by the International Air Transport
     Association and Airports Council International, in turn steering the industry to develop
     suitable solutions to implement them.
 Our approach also includes seeking opportunities to engage with the public in order to
 demonstrate the relevance of our internationally acclaimed research, to disseminate our work to
 the wider public and to increase awareness of the effect and benefit our research has for the
 quality of life of society in general. Two of our five impact case studies result from these types of
 opportunities:
 •   ‘Rewriting the ACM’s Code of Ethics’: Research conducted at CCSR underpinned the 2016–
     2018 rewrite of the original 1992 Code of Ethics of the ACM. This research was done in
     conjunction with leading computer ethics and industry experts in the USA and ACM
     members around the world. The modernisation of the Code is globally shaping the discourse
     around ethics and professionalism in the computing field. Beneficiaries include the 100,000+
     members of the ACM, who are required to abide by it; society, benefiting from
     implementation; industry and academia, benefiting from its framework; and educators at all
     levels, for use in ICT teaching and training.
 •   ‘The Ethics of Sex Robots and Harms to Women and Girls’: Richardson’s research has
     been following the making of anthropomorphic robots since 2001, which are promoted as
     relational others, and engineered and sold as ‘lovers’, ‘therapists’, ‘sexual partners’ or
     ‘friends’. Richardson has identified the development of these robots as socially problematic,
     urging caution for some and the banning of others (sex robots in the form of women and
     girls). In 2015, she founded the Campaign Against Sex Robots (CASR) which has had over
     350,000 views on topics relating to the ethics of sex robots. This has led to a global ethical
     discussion about the normalising of sex robots in the form of women and girls and led to the
     development of legislation in the US: the Curbing Realistic Exploitative Electronic Pedophilic
     Robots (CREEPER) Act. Richardson’s work is underpinned by a humanistic ethics and has
     led to her being invited to events to speak on her robots research, including SWSW
     (Frankfurt), SIBOS (world’s largest banking conference), and Web Summit (international
     technology conference).

 The ultimate aim of our approach to impact is to encourage high-quality applied research that
 impacts (Figure 2) both academics (IAI research work on uncertainty, fuzzy logic, optimisation
 and intelligent transport) and society (CCSR research work on the ethical and social implications
 of ICT) while identifying projects with potential for impact at an early stage to facilitate the
 realisation of this future impact with industry (CTI research work on car safety, cyber incident
 response in CNI and experiential learning and simulation).
 The Unit’s goals for supporting and enabling impact from its research in the future include:
 •   To maintain a dynamic and pervasive research environment supported by a robust research
     infrastructure, and to encourage a scholarly culture where staff undertake ambitious,
     innovative and rigorous research with impact on the wider society.
 •   To ensure, through the allocation of resources and appropriate staffing, that our world-
     leading and internationally excellent research is disseminated to as broad an audience as
     possible.
 •   To work with our stakeholder community (through knowledge exchange, collaboration and
     partnership) as well as with national and international partners, to promote research,
     technology and education and to increase our research profile and the level of impact of our
     research on the wider society.
 •   To ensure that internal research funding is made available for projects that aim to establish
     links for the purpose of maximising impact. Public engagement activities will also be
     encouraged by placing more emphasis on the implementation of outreach activities in the
     criteria for the award of internal funding.
 •   To communicate effectively and equally to both academic and non-academic audiences
     through the continual improvement of our web presence and the strategic targeting of events
     that engage with stakeholders.
 •   To ensure that there is a pipeline of information from the School to the press office at DMU
     so that opportunities to enhance the research profile and successes of the School in
     national, international and sector media are exploited.
 Section 2. People

 2.1 STAFFING STRATEGY AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT
 DMU is committed to recruiting and appointing academic staff with demonstrable or emergent
 research excellence with a strategic focus on fostering and supporting early career staff. The
 research strategy for the School has its researchers at its heart, and delivers its vision and
 mission through strong leadership, meaningful engagement and the development of a high-
 performance culture where researchers are supported to deliver excellence in research with
 confidence. To be able to respond to the changing demands of the marketplace, our staffing
 strategy has been addressed using the following headings:
 2.1.1 Staffing and recruitment policy
 DMU’s aspiration to be a more research-intensive university requires having a more diverse and
 more highly qualified research community and maintaining our ethos of social and ethical
 values. Motivated, high-achieving staff members are essential to research excellence. We
 aimed during this census period to recruit the best and retain them through training and
 mentorship while also offering rewards for their contribution to research excellence (described
 next). Research track record/potential was a key element in all our recruitment opportunities
 during this census period. We aimed to build a sustainable research environment by maintaining
 a sensible balance between recruiting acknowledged research leaders, and potential research
 leaders (see Tables 5a–b and Figure 3 in section 2.3). We will continue to monitor the
 recruitment of new researchers to ensure we build capability and capacity. The School has
 recruited a significant body of excellent researchers through our Vice-Chancellor’s 2020
 (VC2020) lectureship programme, amounting to 36% (20 out of 56) of our submitted staff, some

                                                                                                Page 8
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 of whom have already moved to more senior career positions since their joining our School.
 VC2020s are given a light teaching load in their first academic year with at least 50% of their
 time given for research and PhD supervision and £2,000 start-up (replaced in 2017 by internal
 bid for up to £5,000; see 2.1.2) for their personal development to enable progress along a
 teaching and research trajectory. The time and money support we provide our ECRs aims to
 ensure we harness their excellence and enthusiasm to the full. Many of our recruited VC2020s
 have already established themselves as strong research leaders and we will continue to support
 existing appointees and recruit new ones. New staff members are appointed with a probation
 period, which feeds into their first annual appraisal process, where relevant discussions around
 research leads, where appropriate, to dedicated quality research time articulated in individual
 workloads as elaborated next. The Unit has also recruited recent PhD graduates through our
 Early Career Academic Fellows (ECAF) programme, who are appointed to a one-year post that
 can lead to a full VC2020 lectureship. Up to 73% of our submitted staff to the REF 2021 are
 appointments made since January 2014: 4 professors/senior staff; 5 readers/associate
 professors; 32 senior lecturers/lecturers/ECAFs. To facilitate the integration of each new
 member of staff, we offer them a Faculty staff induction session on research and innovation
 covering the Faculty research vision, research aims and strategy, including our research and
 enterprise key performance targets and the indicators to measure success as well as their link to
 the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs); our Faculty Policy and
 Guidance, as well as where and how to get Research and Innovation (Enterprise) support from
 our Faculty’s Research and Innovation Office and University’s RSD; from our Faculty Associate
 Dean of Research and Innovation regarding processes for submitting research bids, applying for
 research allowances and appointing research students; as well as information on mandatory/
 recommended training and development; and effective use of MyAppraisal. We also have in
 place a Faculty VC2020/ECAF champion, and poster events to disseminate the new knowledge
 and experience of our VC2020/ECAF colleagues.
 2.1.2 Staff development and support
 Our commitment to the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers informed
 our Concordat Action Plans (2018–2020) and secured us the HR Excellence in Research Award
 in 2018. Over the census period, the implementation of consistent support and mentoring for
 staff in research and capacity-building activities has been an effective mechanism to
 successfully build upon research excellence. The School’s plans at the institute level include
 development funding to attend high-quality conferences. The School has in place a mentoring
 process that enables established researchers to take advantage of more effective opportunities
 to engage in research while also being able to assist our VC2020 ECRs. A key element
 implemented during the current census to help staff develop and plan their research career is
 the annual ‘Research and Innovation Allocation’ (RIA) scheme, which is peer reviewed and
 assessed by a School-based panel. In addition to a 10% scholarship allocation, staff are able to
 apply for 320–640 hours per annum (amounting to between 1–2 days per week). RIAs are
 submitted yearly, describing developmental and research activities to be undertaken. All our
 researchers are required to complete the University’s Equality and Diversity training; the
 Certificate in Research Supervision course is also compulsory to act as supervisor for research
 degree students. Researchers are also invited to give lectures / deliver training courses to PGR
 students in the Unit’s Doctoral Training Programmes (DTPs).
 Support is given to our individual researchers and research institutes in raising the profile of their
 research, the work of their Institute, and the University as a whole, using a variety of competitive
 schemes with the support of the RSD (see 3.2):
 •   A DMU-wide Research Leave Scheme offering a term of research leave to staff: Ahmadi,
     McBride and Picinali (worth approximately £21,000);
 •   Higher Education Innovation Funding (HEIF) to support and develop a broad range of
     knowledge exchange activities between universities and the wider world, which result in
     economic and social benefits to the UK (since 2011);
 •   Research Investment Fund (RIF) to support new initiatives to build our research capacity,
     performance and reputation (since 2010);
                                                                                                Page 9
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 •   Research Capital Investment Fund (RCIF) to sustain and develop DMU’s research
     equipment base (since 2010);
 •   Annual ring-fenced funds to support pump-priming and funding for new talent through the
     FCEM VC2020s additional funds (up to £5,000 per project), with special attention to ECRs,
     to ensure a smooth transition into academic life so that they are ready to make a major
     contribution to the REF, and that they are supported in developing outstanding research
     profiles (since 2017);
 •   DMU Doctoral College PhD Scholarships (full bursary; fee waiver) for projects aligned with
     the University–Faculty–Unit strategy and relevant to one or more of the 17 SDGs and a
     supervisory team combining early career (e.g. VC2020) with more senior academics (since
     2010); awarded 31 PhD scholarships – 16 fees-only that included 5 overseas studentships;
     15 fees and stipend and 1 EPSRC scholarship;
 •   The Future Research Leaders Programme (since 2012) offers monthly developmental
     sessions over a year-long course to develop researchers’ leadership skills (Yevseyeva, He).
     Those unsuccessful in getting a place on the programme may be selected for the Leading
     Research Mentoring programme;
 •   An ECR network (since 2012) with training programmes (including writing retreats and
     workshops) and mentoring from senior staff;
 •   Regular CEM Research Away Days (since 2012) to allow staff to meet colleagues in the
     School to encourage internal new research collaboration activities and links.
 Specific support is also provided to the Unit’s researchers for knowledge exchange through the
 RSD’s activities including:
 •   hands-on training for developing scientific and transferable skills for R&D careers in both
     industry and academia (entrepreneurship, research integrity, proposal preparation, patent
     applications, IPR management, take up and exploitation of research results etc.);
 •   workshops on Commercialisation of Research, IPR, Open Access, KTPs and related
     schemes;
 •   active training on research and financial management of the research projects; organisation
     of scientific/training/dissemination events; communication, outreach activities and horizontal
     skills; and training dedicated to gender issues.
 2.1.3 Staff recognition and rewards
 In order for the School to become a location of choice for staff at all career stages it is important
 that research talent is nurtured, recognised and rewarded. The School encourages and supports
 researchers committed to achieving a high level of distinction in research and scholarly activity
 to seek recognition by the University. In alignment with the University, our strategy makes clear
 that a career-stage approach to research development, where success in research is one
 aspect of career progression and where readers / associate professors and professors have
 more robust research expectations placed upon them, is appropriate and productive for the
 individual and the School. The Faculty has in place a central competitive leave scheme to allow
 a research-active academic to focus on a research activity beyond what can be achieved
 through the annual RIA process. Research staff were provided with a focused period of one
 term for research to contribute to the Unit’s research strategy and REF submissions, including
 the building of research capacity either for the applicant or the institution. Our Future Research
 Leaders (FRL) programme has identified and mentored our rising research stars (Yevseyeva,
 He) and developed their research leadership skills, thereby setting out a path to senior positions
 which several have already achieved (details below). DMU has invested during this census
 period in computer-based systems to achieve better developmental support and stronger
 performance monitoring (new DORA system; online MAX/MyAppraisal; grants management
 system; progression monitoring system and skills training records system for PGRs). In addition,
 since 2018, our researchers’ achievements are celebrated annually in our Faculty-based
 Research OSCARs. Our ongoing commitment to achieving a high level of distinction in research
 and scholarly activity has been recognised by DMU in the promotion of the following staff within
 the present census period: Chen, Deka, Kiraz, Shell and Yerima were promoted from lecturers
                                                                                                Page 10
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 to senior lecturers; Al-Bayati, Anastassi, Caraffini, Coupland, Flick, Gongora, Siewe, Smith,
 Wagner, Wakunuma and Yevseyeva have been awarded readerships / associate
 professorships, while Ayesh, Elizondo and Richardson were awarded professorial chairs.
 These promotions have enabled us to also achieve a better balance of gender and race in our
 Unit.

 2.2 POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH STUDENTS
 PRG students make a crucial contribution to our Unit’s research capacity, culture and outputs,
 and act as ambassadors for the University externally. Built on the foundations of computer
 science and Information Systems or Informatics, our research environment lets PGRs draw on
 academic expertise and high-quality research to develop a deep understanding of their subject
 area. DMU has a long history of fostering new technologies and we always encourage PGRs to
 challenge convention and to innovate. Our programmes also encourage creative freedom and
 experimentation, allowing research students to explore ideas and to learn in an organic way.
 We aim to balance recruitment so as to maintain our reputation across our areas of excellence
 and to ensure that our PGRs receive effective supervision, outstanding career development
 (including opportunities to teach), and avenues to publish their work while in training. This
 assists us in retaining the best of our PGRs as ECRs (Ayres, Caraffini, Fahy, Khuman). We
 recruit a number of PGRs from our master’s programmes and advertise potential ideas for
 doctoral study via our website, attracting interest from a diverse range of people. The
 recruitment of PGRs within the School benefits from the creation in 2013 of the DMU
 Scholarships Scheme that aims to encourage the retention of our highest-quality students to
 study for their PhD; the offering of both full and fees-only bursaries; and our proactive work with
 research councils in relation to their competitive schemes. Recently, in partnership with the
 University of Nottingham, the Unit has been awarded the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in
 Horizon: Creating Our Lives in Data (funded value: £5,800,578, 5 PhD students at DMU; funded
 period: 2019–2028). PhD applicants are interviewed and aligned to a research institute working
 in the area of interest. To ensure academic standards are maintained and that sufficient
 supervisory resources are available, applications are accepted after scrutiny from the School/
 Faculty Head of Research Students and the Faculty Associate Dean of Research if needed. All
 PGRs are subject to the oversight and monitoring of the University’s Doctoral College.
 At School level, based on the area of research and the agreed supervisory team, PGRs are
 associated to the most relevant of our three DTPs: in Intelligent Systems, in Information Society
 or in Cyber Security. All three DTPs provide PGRs with high-quality accommodation in
 dedicated research laboratories as well as bursaries from endowment funds for travel to and
 attendance at conferences (Doctoral College Conference and Travel Award Scheme, with PGRs
 allowed to bid for up to £500). PGRs are offered a DMU Researcher Development Programme
 that aligns with the national Researcher Development Framework, curriculum and infrastructure
 (including an online PGR management system); and School-specific research training through
 DTPs. There are a number of rigorous procedures to maintain and improve quality, including:
 regular progress meetings between PGRs and supervisors – an online monthly progress report
 must be completed by the student and signed off by a member of the supervisory team; the
 School/Faculty Head of Research Students reviews the progress of PGRs and checks that
 regular discussions between supervisors and their students have been taking place; progress is
 subject to a positive formal annual review by the supervisory team and an experienced
 researcher who is independent of the supervisory team. The Doctoral College promotes the
 achievements of PGRs and offers opportunities for them to enhance their employability.
 Additionally, the Doctoral College runs a regular Doctoral College Lecture Series, an annual
 poster competition and the DMU PhD Society via Facebook as a way of connecting up research
 students at DMU to learn from others and make a few friends, particularly being championed
 since the lockdown in March 2020.
 Between 1 August 2013 and 31 July 2020, 117 students were awarded a PhD with a mix of self-
 funding, DMU bursaries and grant funding, an18% increase compared to REF 2014. Our last
 PhD alumni destinations survey (summer 2019 covering period January 2016—June 2019)
                                                                                             Page 11
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 shows that approximately 51% of our Faculty alumni were in HE (some in managerial posts:
 Vice Dean of IT—Saudi Arabia; Head of Information Technology and Computing Department—
 Jordan); while 18% were in industrial / commercial sectors (e.g. Microsoft Game Studios,
 Deloitte).

 2.3 EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY
 DMU has been recognised for our work in equality and diversity. We have been listed in the last
 five years (2015–2020) in the prestigious Stonewall Top 100 Employers league table (DMU was
 placed 40th on the 2020 list); were commended by the Quality Assurance Agency in our 2015
 Higher Education Review; and became one of the first UK universities to receive the Race
 Equality Charter Bronze Award (REF5a).
 DMUfreedom, the University’s Equality and Diversity charter, commits DMU and our School to
 addressing diversity-related gaps wherever they manifest. A comprehensive range of policies
 spanning from flexible working through to Dignity at Work enact these commitments. The most
 relevant to this code is our Equality of Opportunity in Employment Policy. This sets out how we
 uphold the requirements of the Equality Act 2010, including the duty to advance equality of
 opportunity. In 2018, DMU introduced a positive action development programme for women,
 disabled staff and staff of BAME heritage. In meeting the commitments set out in our Athena
 SWAN and Race Equality Charter action plans, through our communications and line
 management structures, women, BAME and other under-represented groups are encouraged to
 apply for opportunities in relation to promotion and development. We have ensured that all staff
 within the Unit are supported with flexible working arrangements in line with University
 guidelines and policies. Family-friendly policies such as parental leave have also been
 supported throughout the census period, ensuring arrangements are put in place to cover tasks
 of staff on leave schemes. This includes making provision not just for their teaching but also
 supporting PhD students under their supervision, and do so fairly, without any bias.
 As per the University REF Code of Practice, all staff in any REF decision-making capacity have
 undergone EDI training along the lines promoted by Advance HE, with a special focus on REF-
 related decision-making (selection of staff/outputs for the REF). This includes those on the REF
 Steering Committee, as well as the REF Working Group. The application of the University’s
 Code of Practice identified a percentage of the School of Computing and Informatics (UOA 11)
 as ‘Staff with Significant Responsibility for Research’ (SSRR) of 67% (56/84), well above the
 target 60% set in DMU’s strategic plan for the period 2018–2023. The School of Computing and
 Informatics (UOA 11) SSRR percentage increases to 76% when staff employed on ‘research
 only’ contracts as per the REF 2021 Guidance on Submissions (paras 130–132) are not
 considered.
 The Unit has actively worked during the present census to improve gender and BAME balance
 in research (see Table 5a). We have increased significantly both the number of female
 researchers submitted in REF 2021 (13 of 56 staff submitted: 23%) in comparison with
 REF 2014 (2 of 29 staff submitted: 7%) and the proportion of BAME staff submitted in REF 2021
 (45%) in comparison with REF 2014 (17%).

 Note: ‘F’ indicates number of women in the population. In the submitted population are 1 ECAF, 12
 VC2020 Lecturers and 6 VC2020 Senior Lecturers.
 It is worth noting that 36% of our submitted staff in REF 2021 in the readers / associate
 professors and principal lecturers group are women (0% in REF 2014), creating a pipeline for
 women to enter senior positions. In the last three years the School has provided mentoring for
 two female staff as part of the University FRL programme. Table 5b provides the Unit career-
 stage distribution by gender of the submitted staff. There is a notable healthy growth within the
 ECR category (ECAFs, lecturers and senior lecturers) (62% in REF 2011 vs 14% in REF 2014),
 which indicates that our Unit is in a very good position in terms of building research-capacity.

 3.2 UNIVERSITY INVESTMENT AND POLICIES TO SUPPORT THE RESEARCH
 ENVIRONMENT
 Over the census period, DMU has invested heavily in central support for research. The
 University RSD office brings together research support in the form of specialist help with grant
 applications from expert advisers for research council, EU and knowledge transfer funding
 opportunities, and post-bid support with grant management (see 2.1.2). The RSD also has a
 major role in monitoring the institution’s research activity and helping research groups promote
 themselves externally, such as through web pages and events.
 Our own Faculty Research and Innovation Office (RIO) supplements this DMU provision. A team
 of research administrators works closely with the Associate Dean of Research and have a major
 role in developing industry contacts into opportunities for research and commercial income,
 preparing costings for research bids, and organising research events and other administrative
 tasks. The RSD administers several annual research support funds from which the School
                                                                                           Page 16
Unit-level environment template (REF5b)

 researchers have benefited: RIF, HEIF and RCIF; this typically supports new initiatives to build
 our research capacity, performance and reputation such as:
 •   the £25,000 of RCIF funding provided to an interdisciplinary team of researchers in the
     School ‘to create an Immersive Vehicle Virtual Reality Testbed by means of 6 degree-of-
     freedom (DOF) motion system, and enhance DMU’s research capacity in new areas of
     research such as autonomous vehicles and gaming’;
 •   the £15,000 of HEIF funding awarded to researchers in the CCSR ‘for the development of a
     commercial grade course crucial in building the reputation of ORBIT and in increasing DMU
     impact and leverage prior research investments, with a target audience of approximately
     2,500 doctoral students, an equal or greater number of industry-based researchers over the
     next 5 years, and revenue associated with the course to be approximately £800,000’; or
 •   the £12,000 of RIF provided to a team of researchers from CTI and IAI ‘to collaborate with
     Atos UK and Prof. James A. Hendler to develop an Intelligent Cyber Security Knowledge
     Sharing System to generate cybersecurity knowledge from social media (e.g. global media
     feeds)’.
 Our research staff also benefit from the RSD’s comprehensive staff development programme
 aimed particularly at ECRs. This covers, for example, training on writing grant applications,
 writing for journals, and impact (see 2.1.2).
 Over the census period, doctoral support has been rationalised through the DMU Doctoral
 College (set up in 2009) and its strategic role in the development of the DTPs across the
 University in 2013, whilst also managing administrative responsibilities for research students
 (see 2.2).
 The School recognises that the balance between scholarly, organisational and operational
 elements of the research infrastructure is dynamic, depending on the requirements of the Unit
 within the census period. During the census period, the organisational element has taken
 priority, with resources focused on the appointment of new staff and investment in research
 funding to support our Unit, including: an external grant-writing consultancy company; a specific
 scheme in our Faculty providing additional funding of up to £5,000 per year for our VC2020
 academics; the Impact/Acceleration fund focused on the development of impact from our
 research during this REF cycle; and MATLAB licences for research (see 2.1.2). The significant
 investment by the School in operational elements during the previous REF period (a state-of-
 the-art Game Development Studios; Cyber Security Research Labs) has also been
 complemented during this census period with investment to enhance/update them, such as the
 development of the country’s first cyber risk training Research Security Operations Centre in
 CTI, costing £150,000, that allows the threat gauged by a cyber-attack to be assessed. We have
 a state-of-the-art Game Development Studios that ‘brings together the latest technology for
 playing and developing games on a range of platforms’, dedicated Cyber Security Research
 Labs, developed with industry partners, which are among the best equipped facilities of this
 type. The relationship between these three elements is kept under constant review through
 School- and Faculty-level Research Committees, and responds to initiatives such as the
 University’s Strategic Research Plan, designed to ensure that areas of research excellence
 continue to receive investment and funding.
 Section 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society

 4.1 COLLABORATION WITH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ACADEMIC, INDUSTRY
 AND OTHER BODIES
 This is a key element in the School research strategy as part of our aim to promote research,
 technology and education and increase our research profile and the level of impact of our
 research on the wider society.
 In August 2019, our Unit led and organised at DMU the 5th IEEE Smart World Congress and
 five co-located conferences: the 6th IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence

                                                                                            Page 17

 and Computing; the 16th IEEE International Conference on Advanced and Trusted Computing;
 the 19th IEEE International Conference on Scalable Computing and Communications;
 5th IEEE International Conference on Internet of People; and the 3rd IEEE International
 Conference on Smart City Innovations.
 The School’s research institutes have maintained strong and lasting external research
 collaborations during the REF census period (with joint research grants and research
 publications), as well as developing new links with key influential research organisations.
 We have established international and national partnerships beyond DMU. CTI has established
 relationships with world-leading businesses, including Airbus and Rolls-Royce, CCSR has a joint
 spin-off company with the University of Oxford to train CDTs across the EPSRC portfolio, while
 the Centre for Artificial Intelligence also provides consultancy work to industry (Rail Safety and
 Standards Board, Network Rail, Birmingham and the East Midlands Airports in UK, Northrop
 Grumman International, Frankfurt airport in Germany and the Air Transport Association).
 CCSR has extensive and fruitful relations, both with other research institutes in DMU (with IAI,
 which has led to several publications; with CTI, shared PhD supervision; and with IESD in
 Engineering several collaborative funding bids) as well as with institutions and research groups
 outside DMU.
