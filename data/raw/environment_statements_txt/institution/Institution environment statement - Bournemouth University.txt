 Institution: Bournemouth University
 1. Context and mission

Bournemouth University (BU) is a vibrant community of over 1,800 staff and 19,000 students
from more than 100 different countries. Our mission is to be recognised worldwide as a leading
university for advancing knowledge, inspiring learning, and enriching society.

Established in 1992, we are one of the world’s top 100 young universities (THE Young
University Rankings, 2020). Our success is underpinned by an innovative and embedded
institutional ethos that fuses research, education and professional practice to achieve
maximum impact.

Our integrated research and impact strategy is implemented throughout our institutional
strategy (BU2025), and we aim to:

   •   Be a catalyst for impact by advancing knowledge, creativity and innovation.
   •   Enrich society by having a significant impact on challenges world-wide.

Our interdisciplinary focus is reflected through four Strategic Investment Areas (SIAs), which
have social sciences and humanities embedded within. The SIAs promote growth across
areas of societal relevance (Figure 1).




Figure 1: BU Strategic Investment Areas

We have invested in five cross-institutional Research Institutes and created 22
interdisciplinary Research Centres (Figure 2). These sit across four Faculties containing 19
Departments (Figure 3).
Figure 2: BU Research Institutes and Centres

Research spans a growing core of well-established, globally-recognised areas of excellence
(Table 1), including our National Centre for Computer Animation (NCCA) (73% 3*+4* UOA32,
REF2014) and Hospitality & Leisure Management (Top 10 QS World University Ranking,
2020) (84% 3*+4* UOA26, REF2014). Emergent research areas include: Psychology, English,
and Creative Technology (bridging the NCCA and computer science).

We have invested in world-class facilities across two campuses within the conurbation of
Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, Dorset. This region delivers £17bn GVA to the
economy and is home to approximately 800,000 people, 28% of whom are aged over 65
(national average 18%). Health & Social Care and Medical Science are an increasingly
important focus for innovative interdisciplinary growth given the context and needs of our
region. In 2020, we were fundamental to the creation of a new University Hospitals Dorset
NHS Foundation Trust. We are engaged in developing/delivering Dorset’s Local Industrial
Strategy. We contribute >£1M a day to the economy of South West England1.

    2. Strategy

2.1 Review of REF2014 Strategy for Research and Enabling Impact
Our success is underpinned by an inclusive approach to research as outlined in our Code of
Practice. To enable our integrated research and impact strategy, our goals are to:

      1. Increase the number of academics undertaking research and impact activities to
         expand capacity and develop critical mass.
      2. Support and develop research independence and research and impact leadership to
         increase capability and ensure sustainable growth.
      3. Maintain excellent, cutting-edge research and impact activities whilst increasing
         volume, enabling a step change in performance.

Since REF2014, we have delivered a landmark change in research capacity with 169% more
staff being submitted to REF2021; this vastly exceeds the increase across the sector of 46% 2.
This creation of critical mass and investment in leadership has enhanced capability and
enabled us to more than double our recognised research income from £15M in REF2014 to
£33M in REF2021. Developing critical mass has enabled the creation of a team-based impact
culture and a more diverse range of impacts within the case studies. We have sustained a
pattern of increased bidding with awards that are longer in duration and larger in income.
Collectively these activities have enabled a step-change in performance as exemplified
through a range of £1M+ grants.

2.2 Enabling and Actualising Research Impact and KE
Our Research Impact Programme brings together internal investment (Table 3) and
training/development offered through our Research & KE Development Framework (RKEDF,
Section 3). This is supported by our KE & Impact Team (9FTE, including four Faculty-based
Impact Officers), and 8FTE Impact PDRAs for individual UOAs.

Our institutional Impact Subcommittee and KE Working Group review strategic progress
including: monitoring/evaluating data returns (e.g. HE-BCI) and making resource
recommendations (e.g. to our External Engagement Management Group).

We have prioritised two-way societal engagement throughout the research lifecycle via our
lively public engagement programme (Table 4), underpinned by a strategic aim to build long-
term partnerships/networks and increase the reach/significance of our impact. Events include:
Arts by the Sea, Glastonbury Festival, ESRC Festival of Social Science, Café Scientifique,
Pint of Science and professorial lectures. Our trailblazing cross-institution Festival of Learning
has showcased research within our community, e.g. in 2017/18, 260 events attracted >8,000
attendees.

We engage and target specific communities, e.g. through our award-winning Public
Involvement in Education and Research Partnership. This has over 100 members with lived
experiences relevant to health and social care and collaborates with external organisations to
ensure those most affected by health and social inequalities can shape responses and
improve outcomes and impact.

We create agenda-setting contributions to the global economy/society as exemplified by:

   •   Helping people live better for longer: Our research on nutrition in collaboration with
       care homes and dementia patients resulted in national changes to practice and policy
       (UOA3).
   •   Conserving waters and coastlines for future generations: We have developed a
       research-based model used in the UK, Europe and America to balance coastal
       environmental protection with societal and economic needs (UOA14).
   •   Helping organisations across the world to prepare for and recover from crisis:
       Our research is changing how journalists shape coverage of disasters e.g. following
       the 2015 Nepalese earthquake (UOA34).
   •   Challenging marginalisation, misinformation and under-representation: Our
       AHRC-funded research of para-sport events (UOA24, UOA34) is shaping coverage for
       the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics via collaboration with Channel 4, Paralympics GB and
       UK Sport.
   •   Supporting creative and cultural industries to grow sustainably and responsibly:
       Our research producing multi-sensory installations exhibited across the UK and online
       (including Tate Modern) provided evidence for how digital platforms can enable cultural
       institutions to stay relevant (UOA32).


2.3 Supporting Interdisciplinary Research
We use our SIAs (Figure 1) to catalyse interdisciplinary growth, e.g. through our Academic
Targeted Research Scheme (Section 3) and new Institutes for the Modelling of Socio-
Environmental Transitions (IMSET) and Medical Imaging and Visualisation (IMIV). The
Professoriate support ECRs to build networks, capacity and teams and encourage
interdisciplinary research. Our Research Centres/Institutes (Figure 2) each span two or more
Departments, are inherently interdisciplinary, and generate impact. For example, our Institute
for Studies in Landscape & Human Evolution brought together footprint research and data
science to develop the ‘PalaeoGo!’ app. Deployed in UK museums/schools, it engages
audiences by bringing to life prehistoric creatures. The interdisciplinary research also fuelled
further collaborations with police forensic teams, resulting in a Knowledge Transfer
Partnership (UOA11, UOA14).


2.4 Supporting the Development of Research Collaborations, Networks and Partnership
We have developed global research networks (Table 5) through targeted investment including
external match-funded doctoral studentships (Section 4), academic conference attendance,
and addressing problems faced by developing countries (e.g. via QR GCRF, £394K since
2018). Our Global Visiting Fellowship scheme funds three-year collaborative projects,
attracting world-class talent to contribute to the internationalisation of our research (c. £35K
annually). ECRs are supported with joining/brokering networks by their research mentors,
RDS and development through the RKEDF. Global networks are used to leverage funding,
e.g. our Digital Reading Network attracted funding from the EC, AHRC and EPSRC (UOA27).

Our success is exemplified by the increase in collaborative research income (+39%, HE-BCI
2013/14-2019/20) and participation in wider networks, e.g. the EPSRC Industrial Doctorate
Centre (Centre for Digital Entertainment) in collaboration with the University of Bath (UOA32).
With >40 industrial partners from the computer games and film industry, the Centre provides
a wide range of networking opportunities and offers effective KE channels. It has enabled us
to leverage further funding, e.g. from the Marie Curie COFUND scheme to establish the Centre
for Applied Creative Technologies.

    Income - Non-EU International Funders           £119K            £1.4M          1073%

We have stimulated increased industrial research collaboration (Table 6, Figure 4) through
investing in long-term relationships with external organisations via HEIF, organising
networking events, funder visits from Innovate UK and industrial speakers, and investment in
new staff posts including: Head of External Engagement, Research Facilitator – Industrial
Partnerships, Research Commercialisation Manager. Our SIAs are guided by diverse External
Advisory Boards enabling excellent connections with a range of regional/national/global
partners, ensuring projects and initiatives are co-created with partners and beneficiaries of our
research.

Our networks enable us to contribute to policy development, e.g. our CLiMB Institute produced
the National Competency Framework for Safeguarding Adults3 in association with Learn to
Care. The Framework has been endorsed by organisations including Skills for Care and Social
Care Institute for Excellence (UOA20). Our Policy & Public Affairs team support researchers
to submit evidence to national/international inquiries, e.g. our hybrid warfare research was
submitted to NATO and is cited in the House of Commons Defence Committee’s 12th Report
(UOA18).

We work closely with Dorset Local Enterprise Partnership (DLEP) to contribute to the
development/delivery of Dorset’s Local Industrial Strategy. We produce business intelligence
reports 4 and local sector5 and economic 6 briefings as part of our regional strategy. Our
relationship with Dorset Clinical Commissioning Group and in the formation of University
Hospitals Dorset Foundation Trust provides important opportunities for research and impact.


2.5 Advocacy, Promotion and Support of Open Research
Our institutional repository (BURO, established 2008) provides open access (OA) to >10,000
research outputs and is supported by our Library’s Academic Liaison Team and a Research
Outputs Adviser. OA publishing is enabled through our OA Fund (c.£620K, c.415 outputs) and
agreements with publishers (e.g. Wiley, Springer Nature, Sage, BMJ). Out of all the in-scope
outputs we submitted to REF2021, 98.9% were compliant or had permitted exceptions.

Our Publications and Research Data Policies adhere to the Research Councils’ Common
Principles on Data Policy and the Concordat on Open Research Data. Our institutional
Outputs Subcommittee ensures research outputs (in all media) provide maximum value. In
2017, we launched our research data repository (BORDaR, 36 datasets, c.2,500 downloads)
and established Faculty Data Champions. We provide data management training and support
Data Management Plans. Open Research requirements are embedded in our Code of
Practice for Research Degrees.

In 2019, we signed up to the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA). A
demonstration of our commitment to the responsible use of metrics, it will ensure our future
policy and practice is informed by this international standard for research assessment.


2.6 Promoting and Supporting a Culture of Research Integrity
We adhere to the commitments in the Concordat to Support Research Integrity, supported by
an Ethics & Governance Adviser and Clinical Governance Adviser. Our Research Ethics
Committee promotes the best ethical practice and our Compliance & Licenced Activities
Committee provides assurance regarding applicable regulatory requirements. Mandatory
training/development on ethics and integrity is provided for staff and doctoral students. Our
Research Ethics Code of Practice and Code of Good Research Practice outline
responsibilities/processes. Ethical implications arising from research at all stages must be
considered. Research undertaken by staff and students is subject to ethics review by our
Science or Social Science Ethics Panels.


2.7 Future Strategic Goals
We will build on the success of our innovative integrated research and impact strategy to:

    1. Increase the number of academics undertaking funded research and impact activities,
       particular in our interdisciplinary Research Institutes and SIAs, further expanding
       capacity, developing critical mass, and advancing new streams of research.
    2. Grow our global research networks to enable a step-change in strategic partnerships
       and forums to secure more international collaborative grants, advance research impact
       and put research into practice, aligning 100% of all projects to UN Sustainable

3.1 Staffing Strategy
Our staffing strategy is based on a culture that values equality, diversity and inclusivity (EDI)
and staff/student wellbeing. Our EDI commitments and achievements are demonstrated by
our Athena Swan Institutional Bronze Award (2015, 2018) and three Bronze Departmental
Awards. All Faculties have a Gender & Research Action Plan linked to Board-approved KPIs
for gender equality. Our Women’s Academic Network (2013) supports women/women’s
interests across BU. Our 2019 gender pay gap for academics was 7.6% (mean) and 13.7%
(median), against our target of 0% (2025). We joined the Race Equality Charter (2016) and
will apply for an award in 2021. We hold the HR Excellence in Research Award (2013) and
are compliant with the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. We are
a Stonewall Diversity Champion and have achieved Disability Confident status (2019). EDI
matters are discussed regularly at our Research and Professional Practice Committee and
informed by REF equality analyses.

We have focused on developing leadership and high performance through talent development
and by growing research capacity in an inclusive way across the breadth of the University,
whilst also developing and strengthening critical mass in our SIAs. This strategy will enable
us to achieve a step-change in research performance whilst building sustainable research
capacity.


3.1.1. An Inclusive Approach to Growing Research Capacity Across the University
Academic staff, including the majority of PDRAs, are employed on ‘teaching and research’
contracts with standard job descriptions and responsibilities for education, research and
professional practice. Our workload planning model provides academic staff with a minimum
time allocation of 25% for research and professional practice. Our overarching and inclusive
Academic Career Framework (ACF) outlines the typical outputs expected from lecturer to
professor and underpins our annual appraisal, pay progression and promotion processes.
There are specific progression/promotion sessions for traditionally disadvantaged groups. EDI
is embedded in recruitment/promotion processes, including checking panel diversity and
positive action statements and flexible working options in job adverts. Unconscious bias
sessions are run regularly for staff; this is a mandatory element of recruitment/promotion
training.

We have invested in intellectual capital, with new academic posts in all UOAs. To increase
capacity and capability, we have invested significantly in new posts at ECR and professorial
level (Section 3.1.3). We recruit new academic staff who are qualified to doctoral level, and
the majority (53%, Table 7) have been aged below 40. ECRs constitute 25% of our submitted
staff (127.6FTE). The growth in our intellectual capital is further demonstrated through the
increased proportion of academics with a doctorate (from 55% in 2014 to 76% in 2020) and
the internal promotion of 355 academics since 2014.
Table 7: Academic recruitment and promotion by age profile 2013/14-2019/20 (‘T&R’ only)
               Under 30       30-39       40-49       50-59          60+        Total

We provide targeted and specialist support for academics at all career stages to build capacity
to undertake and lead research. All academics have a research mentor and have access to
our comprehensive development framework (the RKEDF), which offers c.150 sessions
annually covering the whole research lifecycle (Section 4). Any existing academic staff or
those exceptionally appointed without a doctorate are supported to pursue doctoral study. We
are creating a strong pipeline of academic talent, e.g. the majority of promotions have been
for staff aged between 30-49 (73%, Table 7).

Our Study Leave Policy provides leave for research (prioritising ECRs and staff returning from
family-related leave). ECRs are a target group for academic development. There are internal
opportunities for research pump-priming (Section 2, 4), many of which are targeted at ECR-
led teams; supported by professors to build confidence and experience. We have a lively ECR
Network and offer ECR-specific development as part of the RKEDF. Our bridging scheme
provides funding for contract researchers between projects to retain academic talent; c.30
bridging periods were supported between 2016-2020 (c.£166K). In 2019/20, the scheme
contributed to the retention of four researchers, including promotions to lecturer. Very few
‘teaching & research’ staff are employed on fixed-term contracts (37.5FTE, 5.7%). We have
reduced the number of staff on part-time-hourly-paid contracts, offering them the opportunity
to move to established contracts, thus providing greater job security and employment benefits,
and increasing their opportunities to undertake research; 24 staff took this opportunity.


3.1.2. Investing in Interdisciplinary Research
We have targeted investment in posts linked to our SIAs to drive strategic growth and develop
new areas of research excellence. Our Academic Targeted Research Scheme (ATRS) has
enabled the recruitment of six ECRs as future interdisciplinary research leaders. The ATRS
offers a three-year contract and generous research allowance, supporting applicants from
diverse career paths, including those returning from career break. They are undertaking novel,
ambitious programmes of research in areas including data science for medical imaging &
visualisation (in IMIV) and health & science communication.

We appointed new future research leaders to our new Research Institutes (IMIV, IMSET) to
ensure their longevity and sustainability. IMIV is led by a consultant from Royal Bournemouth
Hospital. IMIV’s strategic growth is further supported by a new radiographer and an ATRS
senior lecturer (UOA3, UOA11). We have invested in IMSET via four new posts – a senior
lecturer, two lecturers and a PDRA.


3.1.3. Increasing Research Leadership
We have invested in growing the size and diversity of our professoriate to enhance our
capabilities for research leadership (Figures 5 & 6). We have 96 professors (31.3% female),
70% of whom were appointed since 2013/14, including 33 internal promotions. The
Professoriate form teams to stimulate innovation and creativity, provide mentorship for
inexperienced staff, and increase external funding, outputs and impact. We have collaborated
with organisations (including Microsoft and Inland Fisheries Ireland) to co-fund five
collaborative teams, each with two PGRs and a PDRA, to stimulate this approach (UOAs 3,
4, 14, 15, 24).
3.2 Support and Training of PGRs
Our Doctoral College (14.2FTE) is dedicated to continual improvement of the PGR student
experience, with Faculty-based Administrators providing subject expertise to our researcher
community, and academic leaders in Departments providing oversight of research student
progress/development.

Our comprehensive PGR Development Programme (based on Vitae’s framework) provides
academic, personal and professional development. This includes on-campus
seminars/workshops (c.160 each year), supplemented by online modules and resource
options to improve access to materials for PGRs based off-campus.

Quality supervision is monitored through the Advance HE Postgraduate Research Experience
Survey (overall satisfaction is 87.1%, higher than sector average 86.1%, 2019). All supervisors
undertake mandatory supervisory development every three years. Engagement by
supervisors increased from 38% to 73% in 2018/19. We are committed to excellence and have
three supervisors, some of the first nationally, who are accredited with the UKCGE
Recognised Research Supervisor Scheme. We are rolling this out to all experienced
supervisors and we will also participate in the UKCGE pilot for supervisors at an earlier stage
of their career.


3.3 Construction of our REF Submission
We defined significant responsibility for research based on staff meeting one or more of four
indicators, designed to be transparent, fair, and inclusive. When developing the indicator set,
we rejected combinations where the analysis indicated groups of staff may be disadvantaged.

All staff involved in advising and making decisions received mandatory REF-focused EDI
development. The diversity of internal REF groups (e.g. REF Steering Group, REF Committee,
Staff Circumstances Board and REF Appeals Panel) was considered at all stages. Review
panels were gender-representative (balanced wherever possible). Regular equality analyses
informed our decision-making. We included additional characteristics, e.g. working hours and
contractual status, and considered intersectionality.

Equality data informed all submission recommendations, e.g. when deciding which impact
case studied to submit, we checked the gender balance of staff contributing to the case studies
to ensure it was representative of staff submitted. Compared to REF2014, our REF2021
submission was noticeably more equal across protected characteristics, e.g. there was a 15%
gap between submission rates for men and women to REF2014, which narrowed to 5.6% in
REF2021.

Women, older staff, and staff with a declared disability were less likely to engage in
independent research (as defined in our REF2021 Code of Practice). Regular analysis was
undertaken and discussed by our Research & Professional Practice Committee between
January 2019 and January 2021. Work to reduce potential inequalities is undertaken at local
level, e.g. as documented in the Faculty ‘Gender and Research Action Plans’, and at
institutional level, e.g. embedding EDI considerations more effectively into processes such as
workforce planning, progression and promotion, and succession planning.

 4. Income, infrastructure and facilities

4.1 Institutional Strategies and Supporting Activities for Generating Research Income
We have created an inclusive environment of research and impact development for staff at all career
stages. This has enabled a step-change in research income by growing the proportion of academics
engaged in bidding activity and increasing the number and size of applications (Table 8), particularly
to prestigious funders.

                                           2013/14                 2019/20                Increase

In 2016, we launched our comprehensive RKEDF (Section 3) offering inclusive, flexible,
personalised programmes of development. Based on the success of our existing schemes (e.g.
Grants Academy (2013-16: 61 staff were subsequently awarded funding >£2M (PI) and >£3M (Co-
I)), we created new Research Leadership and Research Council Development Programmes to
increase the institutional reach of activities. These programmes have led to a step-change in
research income generation across our academic community (Table 9).

Table 9: Research performance of staff on cohort-based programmes (2018/19)
                                   Pre-Programme           Post-Programme               Increase

To support ECRs we have also used open-calls for pump-priming (annual budget c.£25K) to build
experience of managing/leading projects and enable them to become part of research teams. An
example of the success of this approach includes funding an ECR’s research project visual
impairment and the encounter/use of emoji (UOA11), which led to two Innovate UK awards (£90K
as Co-I).

We offer robust pre-submission peer-review of funding applications including the use of External
Application Reviewers who have supported 84 submitted bids since 2017, resulting in c.£600K
awarded income. We arrange regular Bid Writing Workshops (e.g. Marie Curie, NIHR, UKRI) and
Funder Visits (e.g. MRC, AHRC, Leverhulme, Wellcome), and maintain an award-winning Research
Blog. All staff have access to Research Professional.

Our strategic approach to supporting research income generation is transforming our research
portfolio with longer and larger applications and a radical uplift in applications to prestigious funders
(Table 11). Since 2014, we have received our first ERC grant (UOA15), EC funding for a Jean
Monnet Centre of Excellence (UOA18) and our first fellowships funded by the British Academy and

                                                                                                Page 14
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
The Leverhulme Trust (UOA15, UOA4). We run a match-funded doctoral studentship scheme and
have used this to attract £5.5M external income since 2013/14 (220 students). In addition, our
Fundraising Team seeks donations for our key research projects, e.g. those related to underwater
cultural heritage (c.£300K, UOA15).

4.2 Resources and Facilities

4.2.1 Research and Impact Infrastructure
Our central Research Development & Support team (c.40FTE) promote and facilitate a culture of
high performance in research and impact by providing support for grant submission, researcher
development, research impact, research ethics/governance and project management.

We have sustained investment in our technical infrastructure, which supports research and enables
impact including our CRIS and impact tracker (Symplectic, c.£97K), BURO (ePrints, c.£39K) and
BORDaR (ePrints, c.£36K). In 2019, we redeveloped our research webpages to encourage greater
external engagement with our research (c.£65K).

We have strengthened institutional research management, establishing a Research Performance &
Management Committee to oversee performance in line with BU2025 and allocate resources for
research. Our Funding Panels, chaired by the Professoriate, ensure funding decisions are
academically led, robust and transparent, with EDI embedded in all processes. We introduced a set
of strategic principles linked to BU2025 to guide research investment decisions.

In 2017/18, we revised our approach to IP exploitation and worked with an external consultancy to
simplify commercialisation processes. The new approach led to an increase in disclosures and
patents (Table 12). In 2020, we invested in a Research Commercialisation Manager and launched
a revised IP Policy to make it easier for staff to protect/exploit IP.

4.2.2 Research Facilities which Support Research and Enable Impact
Our researchers have access to world-class research facilities. Throughout the review period we
invested £250M to support growth across all our UOAs. This includes using innovative regional
partnerships and two new buildings, which opened in 2020:

   •   Bournemouth Gateway Building – c.£48M, 10,200m2, healthcare, medical science, social
       care and social sciences.
   •   Poole Gateway Building – c.£32M, 5,000m2, high specification facilities for
       teaching/research in animation, visualisation and simulation.



                                                                                        Page 15

We have partnered with DLEP to transform our provision across Medical Science including a new
gait laboratory in our Orthopaedic Research Institute (£1M) and a state-of-the-art MRI scanning suite
(£1.4M DLEP, £1M BU). These investments have further enhanced research in UOAs 3, 4 and 24
including two REF2021 impact case studies. An innovative partnership with the Maritime
Archaeology Sea Trust (£1.3M LIBOR) enabled us to create the largest maritime archaeology
research facility in England, thus ensuring our continued global leadership in maritime heritage at
risk (UOA15).

To enhance our applied science research, we have invested £5.75M in our analytical laboratories to
build capability for research in DNA, cytometry, microscopy, and biomedical applications (UOAs 4,
14, 15). In 2016, we invested £3.4M in an Innovation Centre, including a Materials Science
Laboratory; facilities include state-of-the-art 3D printing facilities, virtual reality, and sports
laboratories (UOAs 3, 11, 12).

Innovative partnerships with local landowners provide access to >76,500m2 of land on private
estates, enabling cutting-edge research in bioarchaeology, forensic archaeology and anthropology
(UOA15). Our external relationships afford us free access to venues for our professorial lectures,
e.g. National Trust, JP Morgan and AFC Bournemouth.

We have an annual investment round for research capital equipment, including Research England
capital grant allocation (c.£195K pa), which supports research growth. Examples include: portable
vascular ultrasound equipment, which helped secure over US$1M funding, in collaboration with Weill
Cornell Medical School, from the Qatar National Research Fund (UOA3); a Kayak Power Metre,
heart rate variability monitors and 3D cameras, which led to a high volume of journal papers
(UOA24); and a Finometer NOVA blood pressure monitor, which resulted in the filing of a patent and
the development of a novel mobile device app for treating hypertension (UOA3).

We provide excellent technical support and our interdisciplinary focus enables researchers to access
highly-trained demonstrators and technicians across all Departments. We have invested in online
equipment/room booking systems and staff to maintain equipment to a high standard and ensure we
can take full advantage of our world-class facilities. We are committed to the development of the
careers of our technical staff, in line with the UKRI Technician Commitment.
