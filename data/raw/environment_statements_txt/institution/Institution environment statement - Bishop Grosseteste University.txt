Institution: Bishop Grosseteste University

1. Institutional overview

Bishop Grosseteste University’s submission to REF 2021 reflects a period of significant
growth in its strategic commitment to research. Two more Units of Assessment (UoAs)
have been added to the three that were returned in REF 2014, there has been a three-
fold increase in the number of outputs (to the equivalent of 122), a four-fold increase in
research income (to £244k in 2019/20), and a four-fold increase in the number of staff
submitted (to 45.2 FTE).

Bishop Grosseteste University is a specialist higher education institution located in
Lincoln. The institution was established in 1862 as a Diocesan teacher training college, it
attained university college status in 2007 and university title in 2012. Its academic
activities are well established in the city, across Greater Lincolnshire and further afield. It
is a member of GuildHE, the Cathedrals Group of Universities, the Colleges and
Universities of the Anglican Communion, and Universities UK.

1.1 Size and portfolio

The student population has grown over the 2014-20 REF cycle, particularly the
postgraduate communities.

The University has a research-informed teaching focus with a strong tradition in
education. Since 2014, the portfolio has extended its subject mix, particularly in the social
sciences and fields allied to education, adding business, counselling, health and social
care, psychology, SENDI, sociology and TESOL.

1.2 Structure and organisation

In 2019, BGU replaced a structure of three academic schools with a single academic
faculty and five constituent programme portfolio areas reflecting the University’s
academic foci:
 Applied Social Sciences
 Arts and Humanities
 Education and Lifelong Learning
 Primary and Early Years Initial Teacher Education (ITE)
 Secondary, Further Education (FE) and Teacher Development.

In addition, as instrumental enablers within BGU’s 2014-2019 strategic plan, the
University introduced a central Research and Knowledge Exchange Centre (RKEC) and
a parallel, teaching-focused Centre for Enhancement in Teaching and Learning (CELT).
The RKEC is responsible for:
 Research and knowledge exchange policies
 External grants
 Doctoral programmes
 Staff and student researcher development and support
 Ethics and integrity.

1.3 Purpose and ambition

The University’s identifies its purpose in the current strategy (2019-2025):
 By valuing all of our people and through ethical and enduring partnership working, we
   will deliver individualised and creative support and transformation to our learning and
   business communities.
The ambition is:
 Shaped by our heritage and led dynamically into our future, by 2025 BGU will be a
   mature, confident, sustainable and accessible university.

1.4 Local and regional context

Strongly committed to the city of Lincoln, Greater Lincolnshire, and the East Midlands
region, BGU is set within a context of local and regional needs, as expressed through the
Greater Lincolnshire Local Enterprise Partnership Strategic Economic Plan and the City
of Lincoln Council Strategic Plan.

The University is also a signatory to a Civic University Agreement (2020) with City of
Lincoln Council and University of Lincoln, identifying a framework with five ‘pillars of
engagement’: education, skills and aspiration; growth, economy and local industrial
strategy; health and wellbeing; housing and social cohesion; and climate emergency.

1.5 Sector representative body membership

As a member of GuildHE, BGU benefits from closer engagement with external policy
formation and implementation. GuildHE supports the development of practical services
that facilitate the enhancement of research activities including consortium access to
online repository frameworks and postgraduate research (PGR) student seminars and
conferences.


                                                                                           Page 2

The University is also a member of the Cathedrals Group of Universities which supports
strategic collaboration through the Research and Enterprise Sub-Group. Collaborative
activities include cross-institutional theme-led sandpit events.

2. Research strategy

2.1 Strategic planning

2.1.1 The 2014-19 planning period

The University’s strategic aim following REF 2014 was to:
 Transform BGU into a ‘research informed’ University with a demonstrable increase in
   research outputs of improved quality.

Strategic research objectives throughout 2014-19 included:
 Establishing a Research Centre and offering a full programme of research education
    resulting in a measurable change in research identity, culture and environment
 Creating cross-disciplinary research units with a focus and growth of expertise
    established in key areas aligned to the academic portfolio, business and enterprise
    development and external research networks
 Supporting staff and students to engage with research in all areas of institutional
    activity and embedding research leadership within management roles
 Increasing BGU’s contribution to local, regional, national and international research
    partnerships
 Growing the proportion of research income generation
 Working towards achievement of Research Degree Awarding Powers (RDAP) and
    enhancing the submission to REF 2021 with a critical and sustainable mass of active
    researchers, research outputs and outcomes.

Doctoral degree programmes supervised at BGU were developed as part of a validation
partnership with the University of Leicester (UoL) during the 2008-14 REF cycle. The first
BGU-supervised students achieving conferral by the UoL were in 2014 (PhD) and 2018
(EdD).

2.1.2 The 2019-25 planning period

In its 2019-25 strategic plan BGU restates its ambition to ‘deliver growth and
development through a commitment to excellence, creativity and innovation’ in research,
and is aiming to bring ‘a differentiated and comprehensive BGU experience to all
stakeholders’ through its research work. Two key research-related priorities remain:
 Achieving RDAP
 Growing the reputation for the delivery of high-quality research with impact.

Specifically, these encompass objectives to:
 Increase the volume and quality of published outputs
 Extend the public impact of research, incorporating local/national/global contexts
 Enhance the research environment through Research and Knowledge Exchange
   Units (RKEUs) that reflect collective institutional expertise
 Grow the postgraduate research community.




                                                                                       Page 3
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)



2.1.3 Covid-19

Research activity at BGU responded expediently to the impact of the pandemic. Through
its partnership with UoL, support was provided to doctoral students including facilities,
extensions of candidature, and intercalations. Research projects undertaken by both staff
and doctoral students adjusted methods of investigation to online modes where
appropriate.

2.2 Research and knowledge exchange

The 2019-25 strategy highlights the interface between research and BGU’s expanding
knowledge exchange (KE) ambition and activity:
 Providing an externally facing and supportive response to the complex knowledge
   needs and challenges across the East Midlands and more widely
 Developing dynamic and diverse relationships and partnerships engaging a range of
   economic, social and cultural sectors, and involving the breadth of the subject mix.

Characterised by its breadth and the centrality of its education-orientated specialism,
BGU is a KEF ‘M-cluster’ university. Its KE overlaps with its research, especially in areas
of established strength and emerging activity (e.g., working with the public and third
sector, local growth and regeneration, public and community engagement) and through a
range of KE fields:
 Business and economic growth
 Education, schools and skills
 Culture and heritage
 Health, wellbeing and social care
 Digital solutions and open data
 Environment and resilient development.

2.3 Research and learning and teaching

In 2017 BGU received the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) Gold Award and
continues to place strong emphasis on learning and teaching, and the student
experience. Staff research activity that engages students is recognised as an important
contribution to enriching the learning and teaching environment, as conceptualised in the
TEF, and internally through programme annual monitoring. As an active supporter and
facilitator of student-research-engagement projects, CELT provides funding which
includes targeting co-production research and KE projects of staff.

2.4 RAE and REF submissions, 2008-21

Following the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) in 2008 to which BGU returned to
the UoAs for Education and for English Language and Literature, the submission to REF
2014 included History for the first time. For REF 2021 BGU making a first submission to
Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience and to Theology and Religious Studies.

                                                                                       Page 4

The overall quality profile shifted significantly between RAE 2008 and REF 2014, with the
outcome of latter recognising a significant proportion of ‘internationally excellent’ (3*) and
‘world leading’ (4*) research activity, and a large reduction in unclassified outputs.

For the submission to REF 2021, the intention for BGU has been to consolidate and
increase the proportion of 3* and 4* research – a primary aim of University’s strategy for
2019-25 as increasing maturity as a research provider will underpin an application for
RDAP.

2.5 Leadership and management

Leadership and management in research have evolved and have been strengthened and
refocused, aligning with the strategic priorities around enhancing REF submission,
attaining RDAP, and acknowledging the expansion of KE and its interrelationship and
integration with research activities.

During the 2014-19 strategy period, the roles of Executive Dean for Research,
Knowledge Exchange and External Engagement, and Head of Research were created,
together with new and separate Programme Leader role for the PhD and for the EdD.
Leadership and management of research also incorporate the role of Chair of the
Research Ethics and Integrity Committee.

2.6 Research centres, units and clusters

The 2014-19 strategy set out the creation of organised units of activity as one of the main
research objectives, given their contribution to building a ‘research-informed university’.
Commencing as ‘clusters’ from 2015, these aimed to align with ‘the existing portfolio,
business and enterprise initiatives, external networks, as well as foster cross-disciplinary
activity’.

In the current strategy period, the clusters were replaced by RKEUs with a greater focus
on achieving critical mass and coherence of identity. The RKEUs also emphasise forward
planning and objective setting for outputs, impact and income generation. The creation of
a total of 10 RKEUs also recognises and supports the growing place of knowledge
exchange and its inter-relationship with research activity.

Institutional level environment template (REF5a)




2.7 Ethics and integrity

University research activity takes as a key reference point the Concordat to Support
Research Integrity, and its internal processes have developed in parallel with this
external policy imperative to steer good practice. Central ethics and integrity policy,
monitoring and scrutiny is the responsibility of the Research Ethics Committee with
advice, guidance and project approval administered centrally.

2.8 Open research

Open research is supported through BGU’s online repository, BG Research Online. In
addition, the University established the Lincolnshire Open Research and Innovation
Centre (LORIC) with an emphasis on digitisation, data management enhancement, and
open publication of research and KE project data (see section 4.2.1).

3. People

3.1 Staffing strategy

3.1.1 Recruitment

The institutional priority placed on the development of its research is reflected in the
expectation that all permanent academic staff are appointed to teaching and research
contracts.

Table 6: Academic staff contract types 2019-20 (FTE)

               Teaching and       Research        Teaching
                 research           only            only

 Temporary           1              5.7             0.6
 Total              91              5.7             4.1

3.1.2 Senior researcher promotion

Promotions processes to Reader and Professor status were reviewed during the 2014-21
cycle. Two progression pathways were replaced by a four-pathway approach, reflecting
the close relationship of knowledge exchange alongside research, and other spheres of
activity across the institution.

Senior researchers represent a relatively small proportion of the academic staffing body;
however, the number has increased since 2016, and especially as part of a recruitment
round at the end of 2020 and through the successful recruitment of advanced
researchers from other institutions.




                                                                                           Page 6

The gender balance within the staffing body has been examined closely as part of
Equality Impact Assessment in the preparation for REF 2021 (see Section 3.4). Gender
Pay Gap and Equal Pay are monitored as part of its commitment to diversity and equality,
with its latest report (2019) acknowledging steps being taken to narrow the gap.

Table 8: Gender pay profile, all staff, percentage by quartile (2019)

 Upper middle       66        34
 Upper              59        41

3.1.4 Workload, performance and audit

A workload allocation model (WAM) was introduced in 2010 and revised in 2015 to assist
with researcher development during the 2014-21 REF cycle. The updated model made
more explicit reference to public impact interactions, set out a more detailed and
systematic framework of key performance indicators, and gave a clearer overview of the
typical activities associated with different levels from early career researchers (ECRs) to
professors. The model is a very supportive scheme, providing time allocation aligned with
the needs and role expectations of staff, including those registered for doctoral degree
study, ECRs and those at a more advanced stage of their research careers.

Annual performance review (APR) was enhanced in conjunction with the introduction of
the 2015 WAM. This includes an Individual Research Plan (IRP), in which staff list
achievements, identify development needs, and propose targets. Reporting and research
target-setting make reference to key performance indicator categories and activity types
outlined in the WAM.

An Annual Research Audit (ARA) was introduced in 2016 as a centralised and more
systematic approach to activity reporting, monitoring and planning. This has brought
more consistency in the logging of activities and supports internal and external research
planning and policy implementation, especially for REF.

3.1.5 Mentoring

A mentoring arrangement incorporated within APR was replaced with a more flexible but
informal approach 2017. Staff are supported in identifying an appropriate research

                                                                                       Page 7
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)


mentor, although this is not mandatory. The establishment of clusters and RKEUs have
provided opportunities to create contexts for supportive and collaborative arrangements.

3.1.6 External and internal project funding support

The RKEC oversees grant approvals processes, including overseeing and directing a co-
writing and mentoring support scheme.

The Research Staff Development Fund is a source of internal financial support for
activities with measurable outcomes – e.g., published outputs, public impact, income
generation, and capacity/capability building. Funded activities are expected to contribute
to the REF submission, application for RDAP and/or BGU’s engagement with the KEF.
The remit of the fund has widened over the REF cycle, typically supporting the
presentation of papers at external conferences (with related published output), external
research visits in support of a published output/submitted bid, student-researcher
engagement and co-production of output, and organisation of public/external RKE
events.

The Learning and Teaching Investment Fund and Student Engagement Innovation Fund
were established by CELT to develop and enhance learning and teaching, to support
research projects directed by staff that involve students, and to include co-production
outcomes.

3.1.7 Sabbaticals

The University’s sabbatical processes were reviewed in the 2014-21 cycle. Application for
sabbaticals is a competitive process, typically supporting the replacement of teaching and
administrative duties with additional research time. Sabbatical support has generally
supported ECRs and mid-career researchers or assisted completion of doctoral theses
by full-time members of staff.

Table 9: Sabbaticals awarded

3.1.8 Staff doctoral study

A significant proportion of staff have been and continue to be registered for doctoral
programmes:

Table 10: Permanent staff registered on doctoral programmes

                Number         % of all
               registered       staff

 2019-20           19            14

Members of the academic staff establishment who are registered internally for doctoral
degrees are assisted with payment of fees. In addition, a standard time allocation for their
research is incorporated within the WAM.

                                                                                         Page 8
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)



3.1.9 Staff training and events

Institutional research conferences are generally held annually and organised by the
RKEC to give opportunities for staff and PGR students to present their work. Policy-
related training seminars are also hosted by the RKEC – e.g., REF, bid-writing, doctoral
supervision and ethics. The work of coordinating internal and external research events
has grown as part of the activities of the developing clusters and RKEUs.

3.2 REF Code of Practice – eligibility and submission

Consistent with the spirit of the REF, BGU has taken an inclusive approach to the
identification of staff for submission. Guidance relating to the WAM, the IRP, and ARA
were updated in relation to the expectations of REF 2021, and more specifically through
the internal consultation schedule for producing the institution’s REF Code of Practice
(CoP). A key internal reference point for the CoP and its determining of ‘significant
responsibility for research’ (SRR) is the WAM, with staff allocated the equivalent of at
least 0.2 FTE self-directed research time considered as part of identification processes.
Completion of an IRP (or equivalent) and the ARA are essential elements of meeting the
criteria for holding SRR.

The profile of BGU’s staffing base is relevant to the approach for determining SRR. A
significant number of staff are recruited from professional practice backgrounds,
especially in education. Staff without doctorates or registered for doctoral study are a
prominent feature of this group, and typically do not meet the independence of research
expectations of SRR.

For REF 2021 BGU has aimed to include all staff with SRR without recourse to Unit
exemptions. Thus, staff involved in programme delivery purposes outside the subject
fields associated with the five submissions have been returned if they hold SRR, utilising

3.3 Doctoral programmes and research students

The attainment of RDAP is a key priority of the current 2019-25 strategic plan, building on
preparatory work through the preceding strategy period.


                                                                                       Page 9
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)


Doctoral student numbers have been growing, supported especially by a major
institutional investment in 10 University studentships from 2015-16. Expansion has been
more widely distributed across the main areas of REF UoA foci. Approved supervisor
capacity had been building to support this development, increasing from 10 in 2014-15 to
26 for the start of 2020-21.

3.4 Equality and diversity

The University took an open and inclusive approach to the REF 2021 and aimed to
return all members of staff meeting eligibility criteria and holding SRR – i.e. 34% of its
established academic staff base.

E&D data are reported in full in the EIA final report, profiled by UoA, protected
characteristics, and part-time and term-only employment. Summary and headline data
are made available in full for audit as required. Data are not given in detail in BGU’s
Unit-level Environment Templates, with full protected characteristics profiling, given the
relatively small numbers of staff comprising each UoA. Profiling of SRR staff is broadly
in line with the characteristics of the general academic staff body.

which contributed to public policy research in the region.


4.2 Resources and facilities

4.2.1 LORIC

Opened in 2018, LORIC is a major investment in BGU’s RKE infrastructure, capacity and
capability. It houses:
 LORIC staff team
 RKEC staff team
 Dedicated space for BGU’s doctoral student community
 Project offices and teams
 Digital scanning suite
 Meeting rooms



                                                                                         Page 11
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)


With £2.0 million investment from the European Regional Development Fund, LORIC
provides data-driven innovation across Greater Lincolnshire with research-related activity
typically including public policy scoping, open data analysis and publication. Partners
have included Lincolnshire County Council, the Greater Lincolnshire Local Enterprise
Partnership, and DEFRA. Examples of research projects have included reports on
company performance, market presence, social return on investment of local Community
Interest Companies and charities, open data on labour and education profiles of local
sectors, and public funding policy implementation. An application for LORIC 2.0 funding
from the ERDF was submitted in March 2020 and was confirmed to support a
continuation of the work across the county until 2023.

Funding from the UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund supported research into the economic,
employment, and energy needs of the local coastal community, and the data needs of
local energy and health and social care sectors. Resulting reports have led to larger
projects with partners that will continue into the next REF cycle.

4.2.2 Library

Research-related resources developed by the library have expanded over the REF cycle.
In 2015/16 the Library coordinated the development of the University’s first research
repository (BG Research Online) with responsibility for research support and repository
administration allocated to a specific role within the library team. A set of library
webpages was developed for research students in 2019.

Five new journal databases have been acquired, as well as JISC-negotiated journal
agreements from four major publishers (Cambridge University Press, SAGE, Wiley,
Taylor & Francis), thus facilitating access to hundreds of full-text journals not previously
accessible. The Library has also signed up to the transformative (aka Read & Publish)
deals replacing these earlier agreements. Two significant donations of research materials
were added to the Library and catalogued: Society for Lincolnshire History and
Archaeology (2014), and Lincoln Mystery Plays Trust (2017).

4.2.3 Laboratories

Three new research and teaching laboratory units were developed during the 2014-21
cycle. The Archaeology Lab was relocated, expanded and re-equipped to support the
launch of UG degree provision, and to further develop research and public engagement.
The Psychology Lab was established in 2016, to accompany the growth and
development of this subject field at BGU and to support possible interdisciplinary
developments with Health and Social Care. The third laboratory is a dedicated Sport and
Exercise Performance Lab that supports student research projects for the Sport,
Coaching and Physical Education taught provision.

4.2.4 GuildHE

The University has developed certain resources as part of its GuildHE consortium
membership. This includes an institutional repository, which holds outputs that are ‘in
scope’ of the REF 2021 open access policy requirements, and the UEA/GuildHE Online
Training Series for PGR students.
