    Institution: The University of Edinburgh (UoE)


 1. Context and mission
    a)    Mission
    The University of Edinburgh (UoE) has existed to promote the public good since our
    foundation in 1583 as the UK’s first civic university. Our mission is to address tomorrow’s
    greatest challenges: through our graduates, the knowledge we discover with our partners,
    and our values-led approach to teaching, research and innovation.


    b)    Structure and size
    UoE is a comprehensive, research-intensive institution. Our three Colleges (Figure 1)
    balance teaching, research and innovation: Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences (£315.9M
    turnover 2019-20, annual income growth rate 2014-20 [AGR] 6%); Science & Engineering
    (£301M turnover, 4.5% AGR); Medicine & Veterinary Medicine (£318.5M, 4.7% AGR).
    Relevant research is concentrated in Institutes and Centres, bringing together critical masses
    of researchers from a range of disciplines alongside partners from industry and the public
    sector to address major global challenges.




 Figure 1: Colleges and Schools of the University


    We host 5,423 PhD students (2020; up 28% on 2013) within our total 44,500 students (up
    35% on 2013), of whom 4,900 are online postgraduate learners. 46% of on-campus students
    are non-UK nationals from 178 countries. Over 3 million learners from every country in the
    world have enrolled on our MOOCs.
    Our 5,351 FTE academic staff from 93 countries include 2,566 FTE independent
    researchers; all are returned here. This is an increase of 46.3% on 1,753 (21.8% increase
    on 2,105 eligible) FTE returned to REF2014.



                                                                                            Page 1
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
    c)    Local context and partnerships
    With 15,400 employees and a turnover of £1.2B (2019-20), UoE is an anchor of Edinburgh’s
    regional economy. In 2017, we generated £3.5B GVA for the UK economy (£5.2B globally)
    and supported 46,000 non-university UK jobs. Our staff and students established an
    average of 65 companies/year (2014-20). Our companies thrive with 81% still trading two
    decades later.
    The University’s key local role catalysed the £1.3B Edinburgh and South-East Scotland City
    Region Deal (‘City Deal’, 2018-27; section 2). Within this, UoE received £237M from UK
    and Scottish Governments, leveraged with UoE and partner investments to £661M, to
    deliver data-driven innovation (DDI).
    Beyond Scotland, we are a founding member of the Russell Group, the League of European
    Research Universities, Universitas-21, UNICA, U7+, and the Coimbra Group.


    d)    History
    Our notable scholars have included statistician Thomas Bayes, philosopher David Hume,
    physicist James Clerk Maxwell, chemist Christina Miller, engineer Alexander Graham Bell,
    founder of geology James Hutton, authors Arthur Conan Doyle and Robert Louis Stevenson,
    anaesthetics innovator James Young Simpson, geneticist Charlotte Auerbach, founder of
    epigenetics Conrad Waddington and cloning pioneer Ian Wilmut.
    Since 2013, Edinburgh alumni and researchers have received 7 Nobel prizes in Physics
    (Peter Higgs, 2013), Chemistry (Fraser Stoddart, 2016; Richard Henderson, 2017),
    Physiology or Medicine (Edvard Moser and May-Britt Moser, 2014; Michael Rosbash, 2017)
    and Peace (Daniel Högsta, 2017).




                                                                                         Page 2
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
 2. Strategy
    a)      Research strategy
    In 2018’s Strategy 2030, we reiterated our long-standing commitment to ‘research without
    boundaries’, enabled by our interdisciplinary academic structure. The Strategy supports our
    researchers to: develop cross-sector and cross-discipline research and innovation to deliver
    impactful solutions to global and local issues, notably the UN’s sustainable development
    goals; engage with digital and data-driven approaches in addressing future challenges; and
    become catalysts for new business and public-sector programmes that deliver benefit to
    societies around the world. This strategy is underpinned by an overarching ethos of respect
    and integrity, where academic researchers collaborate on equal terms with industry and
    public sector colleagues within fit-for-purpose open facilities.
    We support research scholarship in all its forms from lone researchers to major teams. We
    develop institutes to address major challenges. During 2014-20, we hosted the UK’s largest
    MRC-University Unit (Human Genetics), 4 MRC Centres (Inflammation Research,
    Regenerative Medicine, Cognitive Aging and Cognitive Epidemiology, Reproductive Health),
    a BBSRC Institute (Roslin), a Wellcome Centre (Cell Biology), a Wellcome Centre in
    Development (Biomedicine, Self and Society), UKRI’s Strength in Places-funded Global
    Open Finance Centre of Excellence, EPSRC’s UK national supercomputer (ARCHER2), the
    national computational facility for particle physics and astronomy (DiRAC), and the national
    data storage facility (UKRDF).


    b)     Data-Driven Innovation
    Data is at the heart of our strategy. We are a powerful force in informatics. We created the
    world’s second artificial intelligence (AI) department (1963) and, since 1990, have hosted
    and run the UK’s national supercomputer (now ARCHER2, £82M, EPSRC, 2020-25). The
    trusted use and impact of data is key to our strategy.
    The establishment of the data-driven innovation (DDI) programme through City Deal has
    been key to delivery. From its genesis in the UoE-led 2016 Science and Innovation Audit,
    UoE has been a driving force in a partnership of three Edinburgh-based universities and 6
    local councils. Within UoE, DDI is developing substantial new infrastructure to deliver
    research, innovation, industry engagement and skilling at scale within our ‘porous university’
    concept of academic researchers, student talent and industry/public sector partners working
    shoulder-to-shoulder in open facilities to deliver solutions to global challenges.
    DDI research and innovation spans ten sectors reflecting key regional activities: health &
    care; AI/robotics, data science; space & satellite; financial services; fintech; agritech; creative
    technologies; public sector technology; tourism & festivals. These focus our delivery of
    research advances and their translation into health, wealth and social benefits.
    We established five thematic ‘Hubs’. All are active academically, albeit some infrastructure is
    under construction.
          Bayes Centre in data science (£45M, opened 2018)
          Roslin Innovation Centre in agritech (£31M, opened 2017)
          Edinburgh Futures Institute in data for financial services, creative industries and public
           services (£140M, opening 2023)
          Usher Institute in healthcare data (£68M, opening 2023)


                                                                                                Page 3
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
          The National Robotarium (£23M with Heriot-Watt, opening 2023).
    The success of our strategy is exemplified by the Bayes Centre’s achievements. Within two
    years of opening, it raised over £90M in external inward investments, started 15 high-growth
    companies, gained £38M in research grants and generated over 400 new jobs.


    c)       Research Partnerships
    Our strategy is to develop a limited number of deep, durable partnerships nationally and
    globally, addressing specific themes via world-leading conjoint research and PG training.
    Evidencing this collaborative success, 78% of our research outputs 2014-20 were co-authored
    with partners, of which 72% with non-UK universities, 8% with industry.
    (i) UK
    In REF2014 we made more joint submissions than any other HEI. Five continue for
    REF2021; three with City Deal partner Heriot-Watt (the Maxwell Institute in Mathematics,
    Edinburgh Research Partnership in Engineering in Engineering, Edinburgh Strategic Alliance
    in Architecture), one each with Scotland’s Rural College (Agriculture & Veterinary) and St
    Andrews (EaStCHEM in Chemistry). These partnerships include close co-working, congruent
    research strategies, co-ordinated senior appointments, co-supervision of PhDs, joint grants
    and myriad co-authorships.
    Within the REF period we became a founding partner in major UK research consortia
    including the Alan Turing Institute (2015), MRC-UK Dementia Research Institute (2016),
    Health Data Research UK (2017) and Rosalind Franklin Institute (2018).
    (ii) International
    We have strategic institutional partnerships with universities across the globe, building on
    shared disciplines and missions. Selected on the basis of the quality of joint research, our
    global partners are the universities of Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Leiden, KU
    Leuven, University College Dublin, Harvard, McGill, Stanford, Toronto, Vanderbilt, Sydney,
    Makerere, Witwatersrand, Hong Kong, Shanghai Jiao-Tong and Zhejiang. With Leiden we
    have one of the largest global accumulations of expertise in African studies. We are founders
    of Una Europa, an alliance of eight European research-intensives focusing on research on
    cultural heritage, data science/AI, European studies, one health and sustainability.


    d)       Tackling grand challenges
    Our commitment to UN SDGs is demonstrated by conspicuous success with the Global
    Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), winning 98 grants (£60.7M; 2016-20), including
    leading the £20M GCRF Multi-Hazard Urban Disaster Risk Transitions Hub (£13.9M UoE,
    2018; SDG11). With £2.4M GCRF funding (2017) we established the International Veterinary
    Vaccinology Network, initiating an African schools’ outreach programme enabling local
    women scientists to take science to schools (SDG4&5), short-listed for the Nature/Estée
    Lauder Research Awards for Inspiring and Innovating Science. Our research on
    exoskeletons and prostheses restored movement and employment to people with
    disabilities/injuries in LMICs (SDG1&3) and work on machine translation for low resource
    languages helped disseminate information to marginalised communities (SDG10). We used
    image analysis to prevent potential tiger attacks, enabling co-existence of wildlife
    conservation zones and subsistence farmers in rural India (SDG15), and machine learning to
    underpin a new fast method to detect bacteria in human lungs using fibred confocal

                                                                                           Page 4
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
    fluorescence microscopy (SDG3).


    e)    Public and policy engagement
    Our research touches diverse communities from local primary schools and cultural
    institutions to communities in low-and-middle-income countries. Our Strategy for Supporting
    Public Engagement (PE) with Research, reaffirmed commitment to the National Coordinating
    Centre for Public Engagement Manifesto. UoE’s 150 staff PE Forum developed a suite of PE
    professional development courses (>200 attendees/year).
    We work closely with cultural institutions including the National Museums Scotland and
    National Galleries of Scotland. Our research has informed major exhibitions, including
    National Galleries’ Inspiring Impressionism: Daubigny, Monet, Van Gogh (450,000
    attendees, 2016) and National Museum’s Robots (61,000 attendees, 2019).
    We are a key partner of the Edinburgh International and Fringe festivals. Our researchers
    have run 236 shows since 2014 under the Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas banner (9,697
    attendees), engaging the public on climate change, intellectual property in the digital age and
    crime & punishment.
    UoE works hand-in-glove with NHS Lothian, with major academic campuses co-located with
    hospitals. We employ 368 clinical academics with honorary or part-time NHS appointments
    (162 consultants, 144 sub-consultant doctors, 11 clinical psychologists, 51 nurses). This
    supports local healthcare and facilitates translation of our research. Our work optimised
    delivery of care after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, optimising the "chain of survival" and
    leading its Strategy Delivery Group, involving all Scotland's emergency services, Scottish
    Government, third sector, NHS and academic partners.
    Our leadership in criminology and social justice includes the Edinburgh Study of Youth
    Transitions and Crime, a longitudinal study of 4,300 young people who started secondary
    school in Edinburgh in 1998. This highlighted the detrimental impact of poverty on offending
    and criminal conviction, underlining the complex cyclical interplay between offending, justice
    system contact and poverty, influencing Scottish Government’s Child Poverty Action Plan.
    Our research has helped shape public policy and implementation globally and locally. Two
    UoE academics are members of the UK Government Scientific Advisory Group for
    Emergencies, 3 on the Scottish Government’s COVID-19 Advisory Group. In recognition of
    our influence in communication, business and public policy we have won 4 ESRC Impact
    Prizes 2014-20.


    f)    Partnering with industry
    Since 2014, our strategy has targeted commercialisation and stronger relationships with
    industry. UoE has interacted with 2,700 companies 2016-20, approximately half SMEs. To
    enable growth, culture change was vital, exemplified by a rise in academic staff engaging
    with industry from ~500/year in 2014 to >900/year by 2020.
    Early translation was facilitated by £10M impact accelerator funds (EPSRC, BBSRC, ESRC),
    annual competitive MRC confidence-in-concept/proximity-to-discovery funding (£7.7M 2014-
    20, 7 spin-outs, 72 industry partnerships) and a Wellcome translational partnership (£1.2M,
    2018-20; renewed £2.4M 2020-23). The last supports 2 entrepreneurs-in-residence who
    have: engaged with 320 researchers on human health across our 3 colleges, increased
    involvement with bio-translation by 260%, supported 57 early projects, 68% led by ECRs and

                                                                                             Page 5
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
    49% involving NHS/industry collaboration. Over 3 years the projects generated 16
    disclosures, 5 patent applications, 3 licences and leveraged £24.6M grant funding. We have
    4 further entrepreneurs-in-residence across UoE.
    Examples in this REF period include:
             partnering Babcock to develop Fastblade, a £4.1M facility at Rosyth dockyard,
              collaboratively transforming the local economy for a lower carbon future, developing
              new materials engineering for tidal turbines
             partnering with Legal & General (2019) who funded our largest-ever industrial award
              (£20M) to co-create the Advanced Care Research Centre. This brings together data
              sciences, robotics/AI, engineering, medicine, nursing, neurosciences and arts to
              deliver novel approaches to care in own home and care settings
             Design Informatics, which in 2014-20 supported 337 companies, developed 16 start-
              ups/spin-outs and won a £6.5M AHRC translational award


    g)       Open research
    We were early adopters of Open Access (OA) publication policies, actively promoting its role
    in academic and societal impact. In 2014, we led a Jisc pathfinder project (with Heriot-Watt
    and St Andrews) to embed OA into academic practice. We contributed to and adopted
    LERU’s Roadmap for Open Science (2018). Our Research Data Management Policy
    requires data to be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, re-useable).
    These OA strategies have been successful. In the 2020 CWTS Leiden Rankings we were
    ranked 8th in the world for the proportion of research papers (2015-18) available OA. 92% of
    UoE’s outputs eligible for REF2021 are OA compliant. 2019-20 saw 1.6 million
    downloads from our OA repositories (an increase of 33% from 2018) and over 43,500
    individual titles accessed in 2019, a rise of 25% on 2018.
    UoE is a world-leading centre for expertise in Research Data Management, home to both
    EDINA and the Digital Curation Centre which offer expertise in digital preservation, text and
    data mining, computational notebooks, geospatial analysis and consultancy on good
    research practice. We are a founder member of the Research Data Alliance, co-hosting their
    conferences. During the REF period, 2,736 research data items were shared through the
    University’s OA research data repository, Edinburgh DataShare (>75,000 downloads).


    h)       Ethics, Integrity and Culture
    UoE conducts research to the highest standards of integrity. Our leadership underpinned the
    philanthropic £5M Baillie-Gifford Centre for Ethics of Data and AI (2018), which addresses
    public and governmental trust in data science. Governance is provided by our Research
    Policy Group, reporting to the University Executive. We are signatories to the San Francisco
    Declaration on Research Assessment and the UUK Concordat to Support Research
    Integrity, underlined by our Responsible Research Metrics policy.
    UoE co-founded the UK Reproducibility Network, a peer-led consortium to drive robust
    research findings, promote training and disseminate best practice. We published extensively
    on research reproducibility (Macleod, Lancet 2014; Nat Human Behav 2018). Our
    researchers are supported through the Infonetica Ethics Review Management system.
    In 2019/20, we surveyed 1,400 researchers and professional staff to benchmark UoE

                                                                                              Page 6
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
    research culture, based on the UK-wide Wellcome questionnaire. The survey engendered
    targeted approaches to career development and disability further to improve our culture.


    i)       Future strategy
    Since 2019 our research strategy has coalesced around five overarching research and
    innovation themes, reflecting the UN Sustainable Development Goals, influenced by our
    Scottish context. Underpinned by data-driven innovation and linked to the DDI hubs, these
    operate across our Colleges and disciplines:
            Future health and care
            One health and food security
            Societal and planetary sustainability
            Culture and creative economies
            Living and working digitally




                                                                                          Page 7
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
 3. People
    a)    Staff Wellbeing and Development
    UoE’s Strategy 2030 emphasises support for the wellbeing and development of research
    students and staff. Leadership is provided through the Institute for Academic Development
    (IAD). IAD’s 40FTE provide support for teaching, learning, researcher development and staff
    wellbeing, through workshops, online resources, networks and face-to-face advice. IAD
    delivers our Code of Practice for the Management and Career Development of Researchers.
    This aligns with the HR Excellence in Research Award, held by UoE since 2010. Our Action
    Plan builds on our commitment to the Concordat to Support the Career Development of
    Researchers, supporting researcher learning and development. Our ‘Mentoring Connections’
    programme, available to all staff (697 connections made 2014-20) is facilitated through our
    Platform One digital community.
    UoE’s flexible working and family-friendly policies support staff wellbeing and work-life
    balance whatever their personal circumstances. Success is reflected in the number of part-
    time academic roles, 44% of our workforce. Since 2016, we have proactively reduced fixed-
    term contracts, with only 3.4% of academic teaching staff employed on limited-term
    ‘guaranteed hours’ contracts. Fixed-term staff access our Talent Register (152 registrations
    2019-20) facilitating intramural redeployment. On joining, staff have immediate access to
    Shared Parental Leave and Occupational Maternity Pay, the latter increased by two weeks in
    2019. We provide coaching for all returning from parental leave.


    b)    Career support for researchers
    All new academic staff have bespoke induction programmes and online training courses,
    detailed in REF5bs. Staff and PGR students have annual reviews, focussed on the four
    academic facets (teaching, research, innovation, leadership). Reviews provide career
    support, discussions on promotion and wider development through Vitae’s Researcher
    Development Framework.
    Early career researchers (ECRs) are critical to the future and sustainability of our research.
    In 2013, we introduced prestigious 5-year tenure-track Chancellor’s Fellowships,
    supporting >300 ECRs at the point of independence into permanent positions across all
    disciplines. This highly international cohort (60% non-UK) are already becoming our research
    leaders of the future: Chancellor’s Fellows appointed in this REF period have led as PIs on
    257 projects (£54.8M), contributed as Co-Is on 103 projects (£23M), and produced >2,000
    outputs. Over 90% assessed to date have gained a permanent post.
    Specific schemes to support ECRs include the Wellcome-funded Edinburgh Clinical
    Academic Training (ECAT) scheme (£10.2M) and the Edinburgh Scientific Academic Track
    Scheme (ESAT). ECAT supported 72 clinical lecturers through a PhD to a guaranteed
    postdoctoral lectureship (2013-20). ESAT Fellows have received a funded fellowship
    (Chancellor’s Fellow or externally-funded). The Scheme provides support and guidance to
    enable the Fellow to develop the knowledge, skills and experience to become a
    Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Reader after the Fellowship.
    In 2018 UoE was awarded a MSCA Actions COFUND programme (TRAIN@Ed; €2.7M),
    which has given 21 postdoctoral researchers bespoke opportunities to engage with industry
    and a dedicated skills development programme designed to help Fellows establish a career
    in research.
    Our new 6-month Strategic Leadership in Research programme (UoE investment £400K,


                                                                                            Page 8
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
    2019-20) has skilled 48 exceptional mid-career colleagues to excel in challenge-led research
    environments. Participation has driven increased researchers’ ambition and confidence in
    grant applications, with the average value of applications with programme participants as PI
    doubling from £300k before participation in the programme to £600k.


    c)    PhD Students
    We provide all our 5,423 PhD students (2020) with detailed support, training and supervision
    (at least 2 supervisors, formal thesis committees). The majority of our students undertake
    3.5-4 year PhDs, with an initial phase dedicated to core skills, tasters and matching, before a
    full 3-year research period embellished with transferable and generic skilling through >200
    courses run by IAD.
    Our Excellence in Doctoral Education and Career Development Programme (2017) focuses
    on supervisor support and training, mentorship, wellbeing and professional development.
    Building on this, in 2020 we established an overarching, unified Doctoral College. This
    coordinates all programmes, reinforces standards and provides support for all PhD students.
    We host 11 Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs), including from EPSRC, MRC, BBSRC,
    Wellcome. Our CDTs have trained >3,500 PGR students in the REF period.
    In partnership this REF period, we co-led the ESRC/SFC-funded Scottish Graduate School
    of Social Science and the AHRC/SFC-funded Scottish Graduate School for Arts and
    Humanities. These support the development of new interdisciplinary research leaders and
    practitioners, highlighting the breadth of PGR support available. We lead the East of
    Scotland BBSRC Doctoral Training Programme and the MRC DTP in Precision Medicine
    (with Glasgow and Karolinska).
    Our PhD students go to positive destinations with over 96% surveyed in 2019 in employment
    or further study. Our Careers Service training events were attended by 833 PhD
    students/year and one-to-one career guidance sessions by 275/year (2014-20).


    d)    Technicians
    UoE’s research environment is strengthened by the expertise, knowledge and skills of our
    >1,000 technicians. We established a Technician Support Steering Group in 2016 and
    signed the Technician Commitment (2017) supporting visibility, recognition, career
    development and sustainability through training and mentoring programmes. In 2020, the
    Science Council recognised UoE as an Employer Champion. Our action plan supports
    technicians to achieve visibility, recognition and career development through provision of
    clear, documented career pathways and increasing the sustainability of technical skills
    across UoE. We have delivered a bespoke career development programme with over 2,000
    engagements with leadership, career and management training. Our Professional
    Registration Fund has supported 34 technicians to apply for professional registration with a
    professional body, 27 to date achieving awards. 54 of 108 staff celebrated for contributions
    to sustainability are technicians.


    e)    Equality, Diversity and Inclusion
    We are committed to creating and promoting a positive culture which celebrates diversity,
    challenges prejudice and ensures fairness. Our Dignity and Respect policy sets out the
    expectations placed on all members of the University. Staff involved in recruitment take

                                                                                             Page 9
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
    mandatory Unconscious Bias training. Leadership in EDI is provided through the Equality,
    Diversity and Inclusion Committee which reviews data on staff and student profiles across
    the protected characteristics. Each School has an Equality and Diversity Coordinator
    supporting the implementation of our Equality and Diversity Strategy. Our strategy and the
    initiatives outlined below have succeeded in improving the representativeness of our
    academic staff body: 37% of those returned to REF2021 are female, and 13% identify as
    BAME, up from 33% and 7% respectively in REF2014.
    UoE renewed our institutional Athena SWAN silver award in 2018. We hold an additional
    23 departmental awards: 1 gold (Roslin Institute), 11 silver, 11 bronze. Our academic profile
    is gender balanced: 49% women, 51% men in this REF period. 3% of staff reported as non-
    binary in 2020. Between 2013 and 2020, the proportion of professors who were women
    increased from 21% to 27%. We funded 356 places on the national Aurora programme
    supporting women seeking leadership roles, more than any other UK HEI (2014-20).
    UoE now has no gender pay gap at any grade except 10, where the gap has reduced from
    11.3% in 2015 to 6.5% 2020.
    In 2014, IAD introduced a bi-annual ‘Ingenious Women’ leadership scheme; 120 women in
    research roles participated 2014-20. In 2018, we won £50K from SFC’s ‘Can Do Fund’ to
    deliver analogous training nationally in collaboration with the University of Glasgow. The
    resulting ‘Ingenious Women Scotland’ has supported over 100 women in STEM research
    from companies, public sector and 11 universities. 85% of attendees reported being more
    entrepreneurial and 90% more confident about taking risks after the programme. Follow-on
    networking events were open to female researchers from across Scotland; 460 attended led
    by 15 senior women role models in Edinburgh and elsewhere.
    UoE also led a project supporting a gender-balanced working environment in higher
    education involving staff and students from different areas. The product of this is Equal Bite:
    Gender Equality in Higher Education (2017), available OA online.
    UoE is a member of the AdvanceHE Race Equality Charter, Stonewall and Business
    Disability Forum. Our interdisciplinary hub for gender and sexualities studies, genderEd,
    brings together over 160 UoE academics with expert knowledge to address gender
    inequalities. It offers a toolkit and suite of resources for PIs to integrate gender equality into
    GCRF/ODA-focussed research, accessible to the whole HE sector.
    The University recognises the importance of having Allies and LGBT+ Role Models across
    the institution and funds in-house training programmes for both, facilitated by Stonewall
    Scotland. In the 2019 Stonewall Workplace Equality Index, UoE rose to 121st (up 200 places
    since 2015). Our Staff Pride Network won Stonewall Scotland Network of the Year in 2018. It
    hosts monthly events across UoE. We have simplified HR processes for changes of name
    and gender details in staff records, removing the requirement of documentary evidence.
    We are partners in three EPSRC Inclusion Matters (2018) projects (more than any other
    institution), developing new interventions to address lack of diversity in large grant leadership
    (Evidence BASE), improve access to STEM careers for researchers with disabilities
    (Disability in STEM Careers) and developing new models for collaboration and networking
    for researchers with caring responsibilities and mobility restrictions (Virtual In-Situ
    Networking).
    UoE hosts a Disabled Staff Network for staff with disabilities and carers. We provide
    resources on accessible technology, carer support, disabled staff support, estates
    accessibility, fire safety, staff counselling, transport and parking. Our Staff Disability Officer
    provides one-to-one support to disabled staff and their managers. Our Disability Information

                                                                                                Page 10

    Officer aids with accessibility issues.
    UoE’s Race Equality and Anti-Racist Sub-Committee takes forward the University Race
    Equality and Anti-Racist Action Plan. Its action areas cover research, learning and teaching,
    improving Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) student attainment and achievement,
    decolonising the curriculum, improving the diversity and representation of BAME students
    and staff, service improvement, addressing reparative justice to the promotion of an anti-
    racist campus culture. It includes key groups such as RACE:ED, a hub for research, impact
    and teaching on race, ethnicity and decoloniality studies, the Edinburgh Race Equality
    Network, the Student Association, BAME networks for students and staff and trade unions.


    f)    Equality and Diversity in REF
    Our REF Code of Practice covers all protected characteristics (2010 Equality Act) and has
    been rigorously applied across all submissions. All staff involved in decision making have
    undertaken the Unconscious/conscious Bias as related to REF 2021 course, which covers
    the UoE inclusive approach to REF eligibility, potential biases in output selection and
    potential biases in impact case study selection, as well as responsible use of metrics. All
    members or attendees of UoE REF Boards and Groups have also undertaken our courses
    on the legal context to equality, diversity and inclusion in REF 2021 and Staff Circumstances
    in REF 2021.




                                                                                           Page 11

 4. Income, infrastructure and facilities
    a)     Research Support
    Edinburgh Research Office (88 FTE) provides extensive support tailored to the specific
    needs of researchers. This includes horizon scanning for funding opportunities, funder
    relationship management, highlighting prospects, supporting pathways to impact, developing
    applications, research contracts and post-award grant management.
    In 2019-20 alone, we supported 2,800 applications totalling £1,172B to 360 different funders
    in 34 countries. Success rates are high: 39.2% by count in 2014, 43.4% in 2020. UoE’s
    research income has risen by 5.4%/year compound over the REF period.
    This is facilitated by extensive internal peer-review for all applications, mock interviews for all
    fellowships and coordinated peer mentoring for new staff and those at career inflection
    points.
    We provide specialist teams for major funding sources. The EU and International Team
    enabled UoE to submit 1,836 applications to Horizon 2020 over the REF period, with 358
    awards totalling €230M. UoE won 31 Starter, 23 Consolidator and 20 Advanced ERC grants
    2014-20. Our International Development Research Hub provides specialist support on bid
    development, network building and policy-into-practice enabling UoE to win £92.7M in ODA
    funding since 2016.
    Our success in winning competitive fellowships is further demonstrated by 16 UKRI Future
    Leader Fellowships (2018-20) and 91 Wellcome fellowships, 2014-20.


    b)     Innovation
    Researchers are comprehensively supported by Edinburgh Innovations, UoE’s wholly-owned
    subsidiary (78 FTE), restructured in 2015 to focus on industry engagement. This strategy has
    engendered a step-up in attainment (Table 1).

 Table 1: The increases in innovation data in the REF period.

    UoE spin-outs employ over 1,700 staff and currently turnover >£350M. In addition, our start-
    ups garnered £247M investment 2014-20.
    In consequence, UoE has risen from 15th (2015) to 4th (2020) in the UK Higher Education
    Business and Community Interaction Survey aggregate performance table. We have won
    £18.7M from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund. Our industrial collaborations are
    international; income is equally split between UK, European, US and Asian partners.
    Recognising the barrier of insufficient venture funding in Scotland to develop our ecosystem,


                                                                                               Page 12
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
    we allocated £50M of University resources 2014-20 to invest in 32 spin-out/start-up
    companies, establishing our own £12M fund (Old College Capital), as well as attracting and
    co-investing in others including Epidarex (£102M), Evotec (£10M) and Mercia (£100M). Total
    investment 2014-20 into UoE start-ups and spin-outs was £365M. In consequence, during
    2014-20, company formation has broadened from informatics (100 companies 2014-20) to
    encompass new areas including medicine, veterinary, chemistry, biology, physics,
    engineering, geosciences and creative arts.


    c)    Library
    The University of Edinburgh’s library is one of the largest in the UK. Our research library has
    an annual turnover of £10M and employs 150 staff. We provide over 3.5 million books and
    60 kilometres of Special Collections, Museum and Art Collections, along with >28,000 e-
    journals and 300,000 e-books. The Library supports researchers with publications, data
    outputs of research, storage of information about research. All collections are available
    online, crucial during the pandemic.
    We are a leading member of Research Libraries UK, a consortium of the most significant
    research libraries in the UK and Ireland. We maintain close links with the adjacent National
    Library of Scotland and its world-class collections. In 2019, we acquired, via philanthropy and
    crowd funding, the Charles Lyell collection, 294 geological notebooks and >900 letters, some
    to Darwin. Hosting over 2 million visits/year, the Library incorporates publicly-available
    services such as the Centre for Research Collections and the University’s historic Musical
    Instrument Collection (6,000 objects) and oversees UoE's Scottish Studies’ archives and its
    10 cultural heritage collections ranging from anatomy to zoology.
    We host a state-of-the-art Makerspace supporting research with emerging technologies
    including; virtual reality, AR, 3D scanning, 3D printing, holography, advanced programming
    and analytics. Makerspace won the Times HE Library Team of the Year, 2020.
    We use Open Journals Systems as a hosting platform for OA journals, giving free access to
    staff and students. We provide a comprehensive service to help researchers make their
    papers OA, including managing article-processing charge payments from UKRI and Charity
    OA Fund block grants. Our OA policy for monographs parallels REF’s policy for journal
    articles.
    Our research information system, Pure, acts as our repository enabling OA. Our OA data
    repository supports researchers with data management from planning to digital preservation.
    We received trusted digital repository certification in 2014, re-validated in 2020.
    UoE’s Research Data Service provides tools and support to enable researchers to manage
    their research data, including secure data storage on the University’s archival storage
    platform (DataVault), which offers full encryption for sensitive data, creation of permanent
    identifiers for datasets and discoverability through links to records in Pure.


    d)    Facilities
    We host three important national facilities: the UK’s national supercomputer (currently
    ARCHER2; £82M, 2020), the UK Research Data Facility (UKRDF; £8.1M) and the national
    computational facility for particle physics and astronomy (DiRAC; £22.8M). We also host
    major UKRI-University units such as the BBSRC-UoE Roslin Institute (£33M at QQR 2017),
    the UK Centre for Mammalian Synthetic Biology (BBSRC-EPSRC-MRC-UoE, £13.4M), the


                                                                                            Page 13
Institutional level environment template (REF5a)
    MRC-UoE Human Genetics Unit (£59.8, 2018-2023), the Wellcome Centre for Cell Biology
    (£6.3M, 2017-23), and the Wellcome Centre for Biomedicine, Self and Society (£1.2M, 2017,
    extended in 2020).
    We have cutting edge facilities across our disciplines. The EPSRC-funded (£12M, EPSRC)
    FloWave Ocean Energy Research Facility was launched in 2014 to emulate, at up to 1/20th
    scale, real sea conditions for wave, tidal, and offshore wind energy converters. We
    established the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, the world’s largest automated DNA assembly
    platform (£4.8M, BBSRC, 2016).
    As part of the DDI programme, within the Usher Institute we have formed the DataLoch. This
    repository of all routine health and social care data for the Edinburgh and South East
    Scotland region has been created with NHS Lothian, Borders and Fife, Health and Social
    Care Partnerships, patients and the public. It facilitates a data-driven approach to prevention,
    treatment, and health and care service provision, enabling high-quality and efficient care
    within a world-leading learning healthcare system.
    Over the REF period, the University has made substantial investment (£24M) in
    the Centre for Sport and Exercise with its world-class standard sport and recreation facilities
    that are available for staff and student but also sports research and impact.
    St. Cecilia’s Hall, the UK’s second oldest concert hall, underwent £6.5M redevelopment
    partly funded by Heritage Lottery and reopened in 2017. Open to the public and researchers,
    it houses the University’s world-renowned musical instrument collection and is used for
    research, public engagement and outreach.
    One of Scotland’s leading public galleries of contemporary visual art, Talbot Rice Gallery is
    housed in the University's Old College. It is an outstanding centre for art and ideas. Through
    exhibitions, the Gallery is available for cross-institutional research and impact.


    e)       Estates
    Our Estates strategy prioritises an optimal, accessible estate to meet the future requirements
    of our students and staff. The UoE estate has a gross internal area of 864,000m2. Since
    2014, we have coalesced on 4 major campuses (Central, King’s Buildings, BioQuarter,
    Easter Bush). Each hubs around modern student centres, with optimal-for-purpose research
    and innovation facilities enabling co-working across disciplines and industrial/public sector
    partnerships. In addition, we have substantial research facilities at the Western General and
    Royal Edinburgh Hospitals, and share facilities with STFC at the Royal Observatory
    Edinburgh, including the Higgs Centre for Innovation.
    Adapting our facilities and estates to be accessible is a core focus. We spent £15M on
    access improvements (2016-20).
    During the REF period we have committed £560M from University resources and external
    awards to our research and innovation infrastructure; note construction incomplete by
    early 2020 has been considerably delayed by COVID-19. Examples include:
            Roslin Innovation Centre (£31M, opened 2017)
            Bayes Centre (£45M, opened 2018)
            Law School (£35M, opened in 2019)
            Advanced Computer Facility Extension (£29M, opened 2020)
            Large Animal Research and Imaging Facility (£25M, opened 2020)

                                                                                            Page 14
